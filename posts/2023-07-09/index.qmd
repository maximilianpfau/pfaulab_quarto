Kristina Pfau received the **Dr. Werner Jackstädt Young Investigator Award** of the Retinological Society last weekend. The project *“Identification of endpoints for a diseased Bruch’s membrane in Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)”* was honoured.

The prize is awarded for a project with an outstanding concept in clinical or experimental retina research and is endowed with 10,000 euros.

The prize money will again be invested in PXE research. Structural changes of the retina in PXE will be prospectively investigated.
