At the annual meeting of the **European Society of Retina Specialists (EURETINA)** 2023, Priv.‑Doz. Dr. Maximilian Pfau was honoured with the prestigious **Ophthalmologica Lecture 2023** on 7 October. This award is presented to a young European ophthalmologist and clinician‑scientist under 40 who has already made significant contributions to retinal research.

In his talk Maximilian Pfau explained three core concepts of his research that could decisively improve future therapeutic studies for retinal diseases:

1. the use of data from natural history as well as patient‑specific pre‑treatment data,  
2. focusing on mild structural changes at the leading edge of the disease, and  
3. inclusion of hypothesis‑driven visual function tests.
