# A heartfelt thank you!

We would like to sincerely thank all study participants who were part of our research this year. Your commitment has made a valuable contribution to the advancement of scientific knowledge.

Again this year we published our results with great care in renowned, peer‑reviewed journals. You can find an overview of our publications at the following [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=%28%28%28Maximilian+Pfau%5BAuthor%5D%29+OR+%28Kristina+Pfau%5BAuthor%5D%29+OR+%28Kristina+Hess%5BAuthor%5D%29%29%29+AND+%28%28%222024%2F01%2F01%22%5BDate+-+Publication%5D+%3A+%222024%2F12%2F31%22%5BDate+-+Publication%5D%29%29).

Below we present a **summary of our three most important works from 2024**.

We look forward to welcoming you again in our studies next year and are available to answer any questions at any time.

**We wish you Merry Christmas and a successful New Year!**

## Our three most important publications in 2024

### 1. Most comprehensive review of Pseudoxanthoma elasticum
> **Pfau, K., Lengyel, I., Ossewaarde‑van Norel, J., van Leeuwen, R., Risseeuw, S., Leftheriotis, G., Scholl, H. P. N., Feltgen, N., Holz, F. G., & Pfau, M.** (2024). *Pseudoxanthoma elasticum – Genetics, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation*. *Progress in Retinal and Eye Research*, 101274. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.preteyeres.2024.101274>

**Background:** PXE is a rare autosomal recessive multisystem disorder. This work provides a comprehensive overview of the genetics, pathophysiology and clinical presentation of PXE.

**Innovation:** The study highlights the current state of knowledge on PXE and particularly addresses the role of *ABCC6* mutations and their impact on the calcification of elastic fibres in various organ systems.

**Significance:** This work provides a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians dealing with PXE and represents a milestone in the literature on this complex disease.

### 2. Largest normative data set for fundus‑controlled visual field testing
> **Pfau, M., Jolly, J. K., Charng, J., von der Emde, L., Müller, P. L., Ansari, G., Pfau, K., Chen, F. K., & Wu, Z.** (2024). *Multicenter Normative Data for Mesopic Microperimetry*. *Investigative Ophthalmology & Visual Science*, 65(12), 27. <https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.65.12.27>

**Background:** The aim of this study was to create a large, multicentre normative dataset for MAIA microperimetry and to compare predictive models.

**Innovation:** The analysis used innovative statistical methods to explain the normal variability of visual sensitivity and to develop user‑friendly models for clinical applications.

**Significance:** This dataset is an indispensable reference for the interpretation of test results and provides an essential contribution to the standardisation and improvement of clinical diagnoses.

### 3. Need for anti‑VEGF therapy in Pseudoxanthoma elasticum
> **Raming, K., Pfau, M., Herrmann, P., Holz, F. G., & Pfau, K.** (2024). *Anti‑VEGF Treatment for Secondary Neovascularization in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum*. *American Journal of Ophthalmology*, 253, 101‑110. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2024.03.026>

**Background:** This retrospective cohort study investigated the treatment needs and outcomes in patients with PXE who suffer from secondary choroidal neovascularisation (CNV).

**Innovation:** The work shows that PXE patients require intensive anti‑VEGF therapies already at a young age and highlights important predictors for therapy success.

**Significance:** The results underline the need for early intervention and provide insights for the development of durable therapeutics.
