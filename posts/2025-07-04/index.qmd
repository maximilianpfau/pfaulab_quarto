We are pleased to announce that **Dr. Kristin Raming** has been awarded the **Jackstädt Young Investigator Award** of the **German Retina Society**. The prize recognises outstanding scientific achievements by young researchers in the field of retinal research.

Dr. Raming was honoured for her work on **Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD)**, which she conducted as part of her **medical doctoral thesis** in our research group. The results of her dissertation were published in the journal *American Journal of Ophthalmology*:

Raming K, et al. *Visual Dysfunction and Structural Correlates in Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy.* *Am J Ophthalmol.* 2022 Feb;234:274–284. [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2021.07.032](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2021.07.032)

In this prospective cross‑sectional study, 16 patients with genetically confirmed SFD were thoroughly examined. In addition to multimodal imaging, various functional tests were employed, including low‑luminance visual acuity, mesopic and dark‑adapted fundus perimetry (microperimetry) and dark adaptation (RMDA).

This work forms the basis of our currently ongoing **longitudinal study on SFD**, in which we systematically investigate the temporal course of structural and functional changes. The goal is to identify reliable markers of disease progression and to lay the groundwork for future therapeutic approaches.

We warmly congratulate Dr. Raming on this well‑deserved award and look forward to continuing to develop this important line of research together.
