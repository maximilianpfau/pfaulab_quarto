We are very pleased that after our stints abroad we are now back in Bonn.

As part of our return we have taken on new roles: **Maximilian Pfau** as a W3 professor of *retinology and inherited retinal diseases* at the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital Bonn (UKB) and **Kristina Pfau** as a senior physician with clinical leadership of the study centre.

Our shared focus remains the further development of innovative approaches to detect retinal diseases early and enable new therapies. We are particularly concentrating on three main areas:

1. **Establishing AI‑based biomarkers** to precisely monitor microstructural changes of the retina over time  
2. **Developing highly sensitive visual tests** that capture early functional limitations  
3. **Analysing genetic and modifiable risk factors** in common as well as inherited retinal diseases  

We will continue to focus our work — clinically and in research — on diseases such as **age‑related macular degeneration (AMD)**, **Sorsby fundus dystrophy**, **pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)** and **MacTel**.

A special thanks goes to our patients in Basel for their participation in studies and their trust. Care and continuation of studies there will continue to be ensured by **Dr. Ansari**.
