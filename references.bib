abstract="PURPOSE: The primary pathology in most inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) is  located within photoreceptors. Standard automatic perimetry (SAP) can measure  photoreceptor disease severity but cannot distinguish between rods,  long/middle-wavelength (L/M)-sensitive, and short-wavelength (S)-sensitive cones.  Herein we developed a protocol that can provide photoreceptor-specific  sensitivities. METHODS: A commercial (unmodified) perimeter was used to develop a  clinical protocol that includes five profiles along the vertical meridian,  utilizing different chromatic stimuli presented in the dark-adapted state or on  adapting backgrounds. Data were recorded by the Perimetry for IRD (PERIRD)  consortium in control participants and patients with IRDs. RESULTS: The protocol  was developed by evaluating the relationship between chromatic thresholds and  adapting backgrounds using a threshold-versus-intensity paradigm. Five conditions  were selected: two-color dark-adapted, red-on-blue, and blue-on-yellow tests in  addition to white-on-white SAP. Prediction intervals from control eyes were  defined, and physiological ranges over which rod-, L/M-, and S-cone-specific  results can be obtained were estimated. Testing in complete achromatopsia,  blue-cone monochromacy, and enhanced S-cone syndrome confirmed classic patterns  expected from cone diseases. Patients with incomplete achromatopsia showed  partially retained L/M- or S-cone function. Patients with retinitis pigmentosa  demonstrated use of photoreceptor-specific function to interpret different  disease subtypes and stages. Total test time for the protocol was usually under  30 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: Photoreceptor-specific function can be measured over a  large dynamic range using a turnkey commercial perimeter and a relatively short,  practical protocol that may be introduced into the clinic, translational work,  and clinical trials.",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: Microperimetry is critical for the evaluation of macular light  sensitivity, enabling disease monitoring in patients with either center-involving  scotoma or initial sparing of the center. The purpose of this study was to  investigate the validity and repeatability of light sensitivity measurements with  the novel Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA3) microperimeter compared with the  established gold standard MAIA 2013 edition device (MAIA2). DESIGN: A  prospective, cross-sectional, premarket clinical investigation on a medical  device in a tertiary referral center (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT06071546).  PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-four healthy volunteers (median age: 28 years, interquartile  range [IQR]: [26-32] years) and 34 patients with retinal pathologies (66 years,  IQR: [50.5-74.5] years) were enrolled. All participants underwent comprehensive  ophthalmic evaluation, including best-corrected visual acuity testing and OCT  imaging. The diagnosis of retinal disease in patients was confirmed through  fundoscopy and imaging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Agreement between MAIA3 and MAIA2  measurements with mean sensitivity (MS) and at the pointwise sensitivity (PWS)  level and test-retest (TRT) repeatability of MAIA3 and MAIA2 devices (using  Bland-Altman statistics). RESULTS: The bias for the agreement between MAIA3 and  MAIA2 measurements was below the established International Organization for  Standardization standard of <1 decibel (dB). Healthy participants showed a bias  of 0.39 dB for both MS and PWS, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 0.11-0.67 dB for  MS, 0.30-0.48 dB for PWS. The bias in retinal patients was 0.76 dB (CI: 0.40-1.12  for MS, 0.59-0.93 dB for PWS). The overall bias was 0.57 dB (CI: 0.35-0.80 dB for  MS and 0.48-0.67 dB for PWS). Overall TRT repeatability was similar between MAIA3  and MAIA2 devices for MS (Bland-Altman 95{\%} limits of repeatability: -1.16 to 1.53  dB for MAIA3 and -1.49 to 2.06 dB for MAIA2). The examination duration with the  MAIA3 device was shorter by 43 seconds compared with the MAIA2 device (median  duration: 482.5 seconds [IQR: 451.8-537.5 seconds] for MAIA3 vs. 525.5 seconds  [IQR: 500.8-562.3 seconds] for MAIA2). CONCLUSIONS: The MAIA3 microperimetry  enables valid and reliable measurements of macular light sensitivity compared  with the established device (MAIA2).

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze the frequency of misdiagnoses in Macular Telangiectasia Type  2 (MacTel) and to investigate factors influencing the probability of receiving an  incorrect diagnosis. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 288 patients with  confirmed diagnosis of MacTel from the Natural History Observation Registry at  the University Eye Hospital Bonn was performed. Patients were grouped as follows:  Correct diagnosis of MacTel, misdiagnosis, incidental finding. Clinical and  demographic data, including best-corrected visual acuity, symptoms, prior  treatments, were recorded. Misdiagnoses were categorized, and predictors were  analyzed using mixed effect models. RESULTS: Of 288 patients, 174 (60.4{\%}) were  correctly diagnosed, 103 (35.8{\%}) were misdiagnosed, and 11 (3.8{\%}) diagnosed  incidentally. Misdiagnoses included macular hole (17.3{\%}), maculopathy (12.5{\%}),  and AMD (12.5{\%}). Mean age at symptom onset was 54.7 ({\textpm} 9.8 years); mean time to  correct diagnosis was 38.5 {\textpm} 50.3 months, decreasing from 115 months (2000-2005)  to 5.9 months (after 2020). Younger age at symptom onset reduced the probability  of misdiagnosis (odds-ratio 0.96, 95{\%} CI: 0.94-0.98), subjective glare  sensitivity increased misdiagnosis probability (OR 2.01, 95{\%} CI: 1.14-3.55).  CONCLUSIONS: Misdiagnoses of MacTel are common and may delay care. Improved  awareness and imaging have shortened these delays. Early multimodal imaging and  clinician education remain key to timely diagnosis and better management.",

abstract="In addition to the development of macular neovascularization (MNV), geographic  atrophy (GA) is one of the late stages of age-related macular degeneration (AMD)  and can lead to irreversible severe visual impairment. Standardized and precise  quantification of GA areas, based primarily on fundus autofluorescence and  optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, is important for progression  monitoring. Various factors such as foveal involvement, lesion location, focality  of GA and perilesional autofluorescence patterns play an important role in the  assessment of GA progression. Automated analytical techniques based on artificial  intelligence (AI) are emerging in the detection, assessment, quantification and  prediction of disease progression. As there is currently no causal therapy for  GA, measuring progression in GA is becoming increasingly more important in order  to monitor current treatment options with complement inhibitors and to test in  studies novel therapeutic approaches to slow down the course of the disease.  A progression analysis based on structural and functional degeneration parameters  could optimize the counselling of patients, treatment decisions and patient  monitoring in the future.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze the relationship between distance from geographic atrophy  (GA) lesion borders and mesopic retinal sensitivity in age-related macular  degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Exploratory analyses of the longitudinal  microperimetry dataset from a recent phase II, prospective, single-arm,  nonrandomized trial of oral minocycline for GA progression. PARTICIPANTS:  Individuals with GA from AMD in ≥1 eye. METHODS: Mesopic retinal sensitivity was  assessed longitudinally with a fundus-guided microperimetry device at baseline,  month 3, and every 6 months thereafter, using a custom T-shaped test pattern  centered on the fovea. Individual test loci were superimposed on an aligned  fundus autofluorescence image and distance from the closest GA lesion border (GA  distance) was computed. The relationship between GA distance and retinal  sensitivity was analyzed in study eyes using repeated-measures regression. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURES: Mesopic retinal sensitivity. RESULTS: The study population  comprised 26 study eyes from 26 participants (mean age 74.2 years). Retinal  sensitivity of extralesional testing loci increased steeply, as a quadratic  function, between 0{\textdegree} and 2.05{\textdegree} (i.e., knot at 2.05{\textdegree}; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]  1.26{\textdegree}-2.84{\textdegree}) of GA distance. Beyond 2.05{\textdegree}, it increased linearly and less  steeply. In nonlinear analyses accounting for nesting, a significant effect of GA  distance on retinal sensitivity was observed. For GA distances <2.05{\textdegree},  sensitivity increased quadratically by approximately 1.99 decibels (dB)/{\textdegree} (95{\%}  CI: 1.15, 2.83 dB/{\textdegree}; P < 0.001) or higher. For GA distances ≥2.05{\textdegree}, sensitivity  increased at 0.56 dB/{\textdegree} (95{\%} CI: 0.42, 0.70 dB/{\textdegree}; P < 0.001). There was also a  significant effect of time on sensitivity (estimate: -0.07 dB/month; 95{\%} CI:  -0.08, -0.06 dB/month; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate a  perilesional zone 2{\textdegree} (∼580 $\mu$m) around the GA border in which retinal sensitivity  changes steeply according to GA distance. This zone presents an important focus  for closer evaluation in interventional studies examining potential efficacy for  the preservation or recovery of retinal function. With GA progression, decreased  retinal sensitivity expands ahead of GA expansion itself, as an advancing wave.  Overall, the degree and extent of decreased visual function beyond GA borders  have important implications for the design of clinical trials, decision-making in  clinical practice, and insights into AMD pathophysiology.

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of different  machine-learning models in predicting retinal sensitivity in geographic atrophy  (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and compare the  progression of sensitivity loss using observed versus inferred data over time.  METHODS: Thirty patients with GA (37 eyes) were recruited for the OMEGA study.  Participants underwent fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and  spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging at baseline and  follow-up visits at weeks 12, 24, and 48. Retinal layers were segmented using a  custom-written deep-learning algorithm. We used various machine-learning models,  including random forest, LASSO regression, and multivariate adaptive regression  splines (MARS), to predict retinal sensitivity across three scenarios: (1)  unknown patients, (2) known patients at later visits, and (3) interpolation  within visits. Predictive accuracy was evaluated using the mean absolute error  (MAE), and the models' ability to reduce test variability over time was analyzed  using linear mixed models. RESULTS: The random forest model demonstrated the  highest accuracy across all scenarios, with an MAE of 3.67 decibels (dB) for  unknown patients, 2.96 dB for known patients at follow-up, and 3.10 dB for  within-visit interpolation. The inferred sensitivity data significantly reduced  variability compared to the observed data in longitudinal mixed model analysis,  with a residual variance of 2.72 dB{\texttwosuperior} versus 8.67 dB{\texttwosuperior}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:  Machine-learning models, particularly the random forest model, effectively  predict retinal sensitivity in patients with GA, with patient-specific baseline  data improving accuracy for subsequent visits. Inferred sensitivity mapping  presents a reliable, functional surrogate endpoint for clinical trials, offering  high spatial resolution without extensive psychophysical testing.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess acute IOP changes after anti-VEGF injections in patients with  Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) compared to other retinal diseases. METHODS:  Twenty eyes of patients with PXE (mean age 63.4 {\textpm} 6.4 years) and 30 control eyes  (mean age 64.8 {\textpm} 11.8 years) were included. IOP was measured prior and one, five,  and 15 minutes after intravitreal injection of 50 {\textmu}L anti-VEGF agent. The  post-injection IOP curve was modeled by an exponential decay function, and the  resulting exponential time constant (tau) served as the outcome variable in the  multivariable models. RESULTS: IOP raised markedly after anti-VEGF injection in  both groups, without significant difference in PXE compared to controls. The  median tau in the PXE group was 8.6 minutes (interquartile range [IQR] = 8.2-9.4)  versus 7.6 minutes (IQR = 6.8-8.9) in the control group (P = 0.02). Seven PXE  patients and one control patient reported a previous transient vision loss after  anti-VEGF injection. Univariate analysis showed that the diagnosis of PXE (1.12,  P = 0.006), angioid streak length (0.12, P = 0.01), prior transient vision loss  (1.77, P = 0.001), peripheral artery disease (0.96, P = 0.04) and the number of  previous anti-VEGF injections (0.02, P = 0.014) were significantly associated  with higher tau values. CONCLUSIONS: The time to restore to baseline IOP after  anti-VEGF injection is longer in PXE patients. Given the early need for anti-VEGF  treatment, frequent injections, and the possible heightened vulnerability (e.g.,  optic disc drusen) in PXE patients, clinical trials on pre-injection IOP-lowering  measures warrant consideration.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: This study investigated microperimetry-derived retinal sensitivity  and optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based macular morphologic data in eyes  with early and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The  respective metrics were compared between macular subfields and their associations  were determined. Detailed knowledge of functional associations with morphology is  an asset to future therapeutic trial design. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional  analysis of microperimetry and spectral-domain OCT baseline data. OCT data were  segmented automatically within the HEYEX software (Heidelberg Engineering). Data  were assessed for Gaussian normal distribution by the D'Agostino and Pearson  tests, and appropriate comparison tests were performed for parametric and  nonparametric data. The association of retinal sensitivity metrics with OCT  morphologic data was tested with mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In total, 19 eyes  of 19 participants (75 {\textpm} 6.4 years) with early and intermediate AMD were included  in the analysis. Both in mesopic (p < 0.05) and in scotopic red (p < 0.001)  microperimetry, retinal sensitivities differed significantly between macular  subfields in ANOVA. Nasal and temporal subfields showed the highest retinal  sensitivities, also compared to the central subfield. Generally, subfields within  the 1 mm-2 mm diameter ring showed higher retinal sensitivities than subfields  within the 2 mm-3 mm diameter ring. Superior subfields demonstrated higher  retinal sensitivity than inferior subfields in mesopic microperimetry. RPE  thickness was mostly negatively associated with retinal sensitivity, which was  pronounced in the ETDRS inner ring inferior subfield and for mesopic retinal  sensitivity (t value, p value: -3.7, <0.01). In the center position, inner  retinal thickness was negatively associated with mesopic retinal sensitivity (t  value, p value: -2.2, <0.05). CONCLUSION: Retinal layer thicknesses and their  associations with retinal sensitivity show localized differences between macular  subfields in early and intermediated AMD. An analysis including more subjects is  necessary to confirm these trends. This knowledge is of importance since  therapeutic trial design requires detailed morphologic but also functional  conception in order to detect therapeutic effects and pass regulatory hurdles.",

abstract="Rare eye diseases such as inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are challenging to  diagnose genetically. IRDs are typically monogenic disorders and represent a  leading cause of blindness in children and working-age adults worldwide. A  growing number are now being targeted in clinical trials, with approved  treatments increasingly available. However, access requires a genetic diagnosis  to be established sufficiently early. Critically, the timely identification of a  genetic cause remains challenging. We demonstrate that a deep learning algorithm,  Eye2Gene, trained on a large multimodal imaging dataset of individuals with IRDs  (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2,451) and externally validated on data provided by five different clinical  centres, provides better-than-expert-level top-five accuracy of 83.9{\%} for  supporting genetic diagnosis for the 63 most common genetic causes. We  demonstrate that Eye2Gene's next-generation phenotyping can increase diagnostic  yield by improving screening for IRDs, phenotype-driven variant prioritization  and automatic similarity matching in phenotypic space to identify new genes.  Eye2Gene is accessible online (app.eye2gene.com) for research purposes.",

abstract="This study evaluated the functional relevance of relative ellipsoid zone  reflectivity (rEZR) on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography as a  structural biomarker for retinal integrity, focusing on its association with  retinal function. Participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and  controls from the MACUSTAR study underwent functional testing, including mesopic  fundus-controlled perimetry, best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual  acuity, low-luminance deficit, Moorfields Acuity Test, and Pelli-Robson contrast  sensitivity, along with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography imaging.  Structural and functional data were analyzed globally and spatially aligned for  topographic analysis. Linear-mixed effects models, adjusted for age, sex, and  eccentricity of the rEZR, assessed associations between rEZR and functional  metrics. A total of 275 eyes (early AMD, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}34; intermediate AMD, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}152; late  AMD, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}36; controls, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}53) from 275 participants (mean{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}standard deviation  age: 71.1{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}7.2 years; 63.3{\%} female) were included. In global analyses, rEZR was  associated with the mean average threshold in mesopic fundus-controlled perimetry  (coefficient estimate 0.0492, 95{\%} confidence interval 0.0190-0.0794, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.0015),  low-luminance visual acuity (coefficient estimate - 0.0015, 95{\%} confidence  interval - 0.0026 to - 0.0004, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.0092), Moorfields Acuity Test (coefficient  estimate 0.0092, 95{\%} confidence interval - 0.0022 to - 0.0001, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.0285), and  Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity (coefficient estimate 0.0030, 95{\%} confidence  interval 0.0015-0.0045, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.0001).

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate whether consensus can be reached on the acceptability of  end-stage atrophy onset as a clinical end point in early intervention trials of  age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and the criteria for defining such an end  point. DESIGN: A modified Delphi study. PARTICIPANTS: International panel of  experts in AMD, retinal imaging, and histopathology that are part of the  Classification of Atrophy Meetings group. METHODS: A modified Delphi study was  undertaken to determine if there is consensus on the acceptability of the onset  of end-stage atrophic AMD as a clinical end point to evaluate early interventions  and the criteria for defining such an end point. Two initial rounds of online  surveys were conducted. Aggregate results and anonymized comments were provided  after each round, followed by a face-to-face meeting before a final survey round  was completed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Statements where consensus was reached,  defined as ≥80{\%} of responses within the 3-point bracket for agreement or  disagreement based on a 9-point Likert rating scale, from a total of 33  statements included in the final round of the survey. RESULTS: Consensus was  reached for the statement that the onset of end-stage atrophic AMD was an  appropriate clinical end point to evaluate early interventions (82{\%} responses in  agreement). Consensus was also reached for the statement that such an end point  should be defined based on anatomical changes that have been previously shown in  clinical studies to be associated with marked, but not necessarily complete,  functional loss (95{\%} responses in agreement). Consensus was nearly reached for  the specific criterion that ≥90{\%} of such atrophic AMD lesions should have ≥1 test  location that was ≤10 decibels on 2 microperimetry tests (77{\%} responses in  agreement). CONCLUSIONS: There was expert group consensus that the onset of  end-stage atrophy is an appropriate clinical end point to evaluate early  interventions in AMD, and that such an end point should show evidence of marked  functional loss in prior clinical studies. We believe these findings will help to  define incident clinical end points that are acceptable to regulatory  authorities.

abstract="Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal-recessive multisystem disease  characterized by elastic fiber calcification in the skin, the cardiovascular  system, and eyes. PXE is caused by biallelic mutations in the ABCC6 gene on  chromosome 16, resulting in low inorganic pyrophosphate plasma levels. Typical  ocular manifestations result from calcification of Bruch's membrane and include  peau d'orange, angioid streaks, and comet-tail lesions. Advances in multimodal  imaging have significantly improved the detection of these features. Ocular  complications in PXE include the development of secondary neovascularization,  which can be treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  injections. In cases of suspected PXE, genetic testing and genetic counseling  should be performed for diagnostic confirmation. Early referral to a specialized  center is essential. Interdisciplinary care and management of complications,  particularly in collaboration with angiologists, are crucial for treating this  multisystem disorder. Although no approved causal therapy for PXE currently  exists to date, accurate and early diagnosis using phenotypic characteristics is  critical. Early identification of other affected family members and timely  treatment of secondary complications allow for better disease management and  offer patients the opportunity to participate in ongoing clinical trials.  Promising therapeutic options are currently emerging and may significantly  improve management and prognosis in the future.",

abstract="PURPOSE: This review explores the complex relationship between anatomical  alterations and functional consequences in geographic atrophy (GA), the advanced  non-neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration. We examine the natural  history, progression patterns, structural biomarkers, functional assessments, and  structure-function correlations in GA. METHODS: Experts contributed specialized  knowledge on GA pathophysiology, imaging biomarkers, and functional assessment  methods. We synthesized an understanding of the relationship between structural  changes (including fundus autofluorescence patterns, optical coherence tomography  markers, and novel biomarkers) and functional outcomes (visual acuity,  microperimetry, reading performance, and patient-reported outcomes), drawing from  authors' research expertise and relevant literature. RESULTS: While GA is defined  by visible areas of outer retinal atrophy, the structure-function relationship is  complex and often discordant. Visual acuity incompletely reflects the functional  impact of GA, as it may remain preserved until foveal involvement occurs.  Microperimetric assessments reveal functional deficits extending beyond visible  atrophic borders, with varying degrees of correlation between structural and  functional metrics. Different fundus autofluorescence patterns demonstrate  distinct functional implications and progression rates. Recent innovations in  imaging and visual function testing offer enhanced characterization of disease  progression. CONCLUSIONS: The complex relationship between structural and  functional measures in GA reflects underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and  has important implications for clinical trial endpoints and patient management.  Multimodal assessment incorporating both structural and functional parameters is  essential for the comprehensive evaluation and management of GA, particularly as  novel therapeutic approaches emerge.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: The aim of the study was to report the phenotype and progression  pattern of RP1 retinitis pigmentosa carrying the variant c.2613dupA  (p.Arg872Thrfs*2). METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study from 13 families  with confirmed RP1 c.2613dupA (p.Arg872Thrfs*2) variant. Analysis was performed  on clinical data including multimodal imaging and visual function tests.  Progression rate (PR) was defined as the length of ellipsoid zone (EZ) lost per  year and was calculated for all patients. Linear mixed model to predict the  diameter of EZ loss as a function of age was applied. RESULTS: Twenty-one  patients were included in the study. EZ loss in all patients ranged from 3.8 to  576.0 {\textmu}m/year (median PR 76.5, IQR 97.6) in right eyes and from 26.6 to 340.7  {\textmu}m/year (median PR 96.6, IQR 70.3), in left eyes, respectively, with a linear  slope of progression for both eyes. The linear mixed model using age as an  explanatory variable explained 25{\%} of the variability in PR and showed that male  patients had on average a statistically significant smaller EZ diameter at  baseline. CONCLUSION: The rate of progression of RP1 as measured by loss of EZ  appears to be linear, independent of the age of onset. Furthermore, it appears  that male subjects may present with earlier onset of disease as they showed a  statistically significant smaller EZ diameter at baseline. Monitoring of EZ loss  could be a valid clinical surrogate marker for clinical trials, but possibly sex  differences and high variability of phenotypes need to be considered.",

abstract="A greater understanding of the pathophysiology of AMD has yielded potential  therapeutic strategies for slowing vision loss. Structural imaging biomarkers and  novel functional outcomes, both under intensive study as surrogate endpoints in  AMD clinical trials, are new granular tools needed to assess disease progression  and follow response to therapy. These advances have created, for the first time,  the possibility to intervene early in AMD, and to measure success in a time frame  feasible for clinical trials. At the 2024 Ryan Initiative for Macular Research  (RIMR) meeting, a consensus was reached for design of a hypothetical, pragmatic,  proof of concept, 24-month, early intervention study to determine the efficacy of  an intervention in subjects with intermediate AMD (iAMD). Although further  research is needed, using natural history cohorts and intervention trials to  validate the proposed trial design and endpoints, this paper presents an AMD  expert consensus framework for early AMD clinical trials, that we hope will also  be useful for therapeutic developers and regulators. Viable clinical trial  strategies are needed to develop treatments that slow the progression of AMD  prior to the development of vision-threatening late AMD; this consensus document  should aid in reaching this goal.",

abstract="Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a genetically heterogeneous group of  Mendelian disorders that often lead to progressive vision loss and involve  approximately 300 distinct genes. Although variants in these loci account for the  majority of molecular diagnoses, other genes associated with IRD await molecular  identification. In this study, we uncover bi-allelic assortments of 23 different  (22 loss-of-function) variants in AP5Z1, AP5M1, and AP5B1 as independent causes  of recessive IRD in members of 19 families from nine countries. Affected  individuals, regardless of their genotypes, exhibit a specific form of macular  degeneration, sometimes presenting in association with extraocular features. All  three genes encode different subunits of the vesicular fifth adaptor protein  (AP-5) complex, a component of the intracellular trafficking system involved in  maintaining cellular homeostasis and ensuring the proper functioning of lysosomal  pathways. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a cellular monolayer located  posteriorly to the neural retina, is characterized by intense lysosomal and  phagocytic activity. Immunostaining of RPE cells revealed a punctate pattern of  AP5Z1, AP5M1, and AP5B1 staining and co-localization with markers of late  endosomes and the Golgi, suggesting a role of AP-5 in the normal physiology of  this tissue. Overall, the identification of independently acting variants in  three distinct proteins within the same macromolecular complex reveals AP-5 as  having an important function in the preservation and maintenance of normal  macular functions.",

abstract="Stargardt disease type 1 (STGD1) is a genetic disorder that leads to progressive  vision loss, with no approved treatments currently available. The development of  effective therapies faces the challenge of identifying appropriate outcome  measures that accurately reflect treatment benefits. Optical Coherence Tomography  (OCT) provides high-resolution retinal images, serving as a valuable tool for  deriving potential outcome measures, such as retinal thickness. However,  automated segmentation of OCT images, particularly in regions disrupted by  degeneration, remains complex. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based  approach that incorporates a pathology-aware loss function to segment retinal  sublayers in OCT images from patients with STGD1. This method targets relatively  unaffected regions for sublayer segmentation, ensuring accurate boundary  delineation in areas with minimal disruption. In severely affected regions,  identified by a box detection model, the total retina is segmented as a single  layer to avoid errors. Our model significantly outperforms standard models,  achieving an average Dice coefficient of [Formula: see text] for total retina and  [Formula: see text] for retinal sublayers. The most substantial improvement was  in the segmentation of the photoreceptor inner segment, with Dice coefficient  increasing by [Formula: see text]. This approach provides a balance between  granularity and reliability, making it suitable for clinical application in  tracking disease progression and evaluating therapeutic efficacy.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the prevalence and spatial pattern of rod and cone  dysfunction in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and to correlate  these with Bruch's membrane (BrM) calcification. PXE is a rare genetic disorder  that causes calcification of Bruch's membrane, which eventually leads to loss of  central vision. Understanding the functional implications of BrM calcification is  crucial for developing effective treatments. METHODS: In this prospective natural  history study (PROPXE, ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05662085), performed at a  tertiary referral center, 26 patients with PXE (14 women, 12 men; median age,  55 years; interquartile range, 43-59 years), diagnosed according to the Plomp  criteria, underwent comprehensive ophthalmic evaluations, including  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), contrast sensitivity testing, and multimodal  imaging. Dark adaptometry was tested following a 59{\%} rhodopsin bleach at 8{\textdegree}, 15{\textdegree},  30{\textdegree}, and 46{\textdegree} eccentricity from the fovea along the temporal retina. The eye  without a history of exudative macular neovascularization (MNV) or the  better-seeing eye was selected as the study eye. RESULTS: Of 26 participants, 12  had no history of exudative MNV in the study eye, while 14 had previous or  current treatment for MNV with a median BCVA of -0.07 logMAR and 0.11 logMAR,  respectively. In the macula at 8{\textdegree} eccentricity, rod intercept time (RIT) was  prolonged in 83.3{\%} of nonexudative and 92.9{\%} of exudative eyes, while BCVA and  cone thresholds at 8{\textdegree} eccentricity were affected in only 42.3{\%} and 65.4{\%} of eyes.  The delay in RIT was most pronounced in regions at risk of calcification and  increased markedly with age. In addition, prolonged cone recovery time constants  were evident that correlated with RIT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PXE exhibit  significant slowing of both cone- and rod-mediated dark adaptation, particularly  in regions prone to BrM calcification. These findings suggest that dark  adaptometry and assessment of BrM calcification can serve as clinical tools for  evaluating disease severity and monitoring progression in PXE, enabling earlier  interventions before the onset of exudative MNV or atrophy.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To examine relationships between retinal structure and visual function  in geographic atrophy (GA) by analyzing spatial agreement between absolute  scotomas and macular structure, focusing on (1) choroidal hypertransmission, a  key feature of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy  (cRORA), and (2) fundus autofluorescence (FAF)-defined GA. METHODS: Mesopic  microperimetry (using a novel T-shaped pattern) and multimodal imaging were  recorded longitudinally in a phase II GA trial. Horizontal and vertical optical  coherence tomography (OCT) line scans (corresponding to the T axes) were graded  for choroidal hypertransmission; FAF images were graded for GA. Spatial  concordance between zones of absolute scotoma and atrophy was quantified by the  Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). RESULTS: The analysis population comprised 24  participants (mean follow-up 26.8 months). For concordance between absolute  scotoma and choroidal hypertransmission, estimated mean DSC was 0.70 (95{\%}  confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.77). This was significantly higher than for  FAF-defined GA (0.67; 95{\%} CI, 0.61-0.74; estimated mean difference = 0.03, 95{\%}  CI, 0.02-0.05, P < 0.001). Mean OCT choroidal reflectivity was strongly  associated with likelihood and severity of scotoma. CONCLUSIONS: Spatial  concordance between absolute scotomas and GA structural features is moderately  high and slightly higher for choroidal hypertransmission than FAF-defined GA.  This supports choroidal hypertransmission, a key cRORA feature, as an outcome  measure in interventional trials. OCT provides more information to explain visual  function than FAF alone. However, given some discordance for both structural  features, performing microperimetry alongside imaging remains important.  TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: These findings provide insights into the complex  relationship between retinal structure and visual function and contribute to a  nuanced understanding of outcome measures.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and utility of  optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based, targeted microperimetry grids in  assessing focal lesions in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD).  METHODS: The multicenter, prospective PINNACLE study enrolled 395 patients with  iAMD aged 55 to 90 years across 12 international sites. Participants underwent  imaging, including OCT and microperimetry, every 4 to 12 months over 3 years.  Deep learning algorithms detected focal lesions and changes in OCT images,  including drusen regression, EZ/IZ loss with hypertransmission, and subretinal  fluid, guiding 5-point microperimetry targeted to lesion locations. Data were  analyzed using linear mixed models to estimate differences between retinal  sensitivity measured by the 5-point focal grids and sensitivity interpolated from  the 24-point standard grids. RESULTS: The final analysis included 93 eyes from 83  patients, assessing 605 of the 5-point targeted grids and standard grids across  235 focal lesions. The Pearson correlation between focally measured sensitivity  and interpolated sensitivity was 0.76. However, interpolation from the standard  grid could be erroneous, especially in central regions of lesions characterized  by EZ/IZ loss with hypertransmission and subretinal fluid. Interpolation errors  increased with distance to the nearest measurement point (slope = 2.20 dB per  degree, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 1.52 to 2.87). A significant negative  relationship was found between interpolation errors and retinal sensitivity, with  the highest errors in areas of low sensitivity. Lesion size significantly  impacted interpolation errors for EZ/IZ loss with hypertransmission (slope =  -19.41 dB/mm{\texttwosuperior}, 95{\%} CI = -29.63 to -9.18). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted grids improved  the detection and understanding of how focal retinal changes affect visual  function in patients with iAMD, supporting the development of therapeutic  interventions.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity (rEZR) is an innovative  biomarker for photoreceptor alterations and showed association with disease  staging in macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). However, its prognostic  relevance for the ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss is unclear. METHODS: Longitudinal  spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging of patients with  MacTel from an observational natural history study was used for en face  determination of manifest EZ loss. The rEZR was assessed globally (mean  rEZR/SD-OCT volume scan) and topographically (spatially refined). Logistic and  linear-mixed effect models were used to investigate the rEZR's association with  EZ loss onset and the (square-root transformed) progression rate of existing EZ  loss. RESULTS: A total of 97 eyes of 70 patients (39 women, mean age = 60.3 {\textpm}  8.9 years) were included and reviewed in a median observational period of 28.7  months (range = 20.3-49.9 months). Whereas 65 eyes of 44 patients showed manifest  EZ loss (mean {\textpm} SD area = 0.44 {\textpm} 0.57 mm2) at baseline, 14 eyes of 14 patients  developed EZ loss over time. Significant associations of the rEZR were only found  in the topographical analyses indicated by lower rEZR values and a higher risk  for EZ loss onset (odds ratio [OR] = 0.34, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 0.29 to  0.39, P < 0.001) as well as a faster EZ loss progression (coefficient estimate =  -0.002, 95{\%} CI = -0.0046 to 0.0001, P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: This study  demonstrates the prognostic relevance of spatially refined rEZR changes before  and beyond already existing EZ loss for both its onset and progression over time  in MacTel. Further analyses of the rEZR are warranted to achieve both a more  tailored patient selection and a novel end point identification for clinical  trials in MacTel.",

abstract="Glomerular nephropathy resulting from the genetic defects in COL4A3/4/5 genes  including the classical Alport syndrome is the second most common hereditary  kidney disease characterized by persistent haematuria progressing to the need for  kidney replacement therapy, frequently associated with sensorineural deafness,  and occasionally with ocular anomalies. Diagnosis and management of COL4A3/4/5  glomerulopathy is a great challenge due to its phenotypic heterogeneity, multiple  modes of inheritance, variable expressivity, and disease penetrance of individual  variants as well as imperfect prognostic and progression factors and scarce and  limited clinical trials, especially in children. As a joint initiative of the  European Rare Kidney disease reference Network (ERKNet), European Renal  Association (ERA Genes{\&}Kidney), and European Society for Paediatric Nephrology  (ESPN) Inherited renal disorders working group, a team of experts including adult  and paediatric nephrologists, kidney geneticists, audiologists, ophthalmologists,  and a kidney pathologist were selected to perform a systematic literature review  on 21 clinically relevant PICO (Patient or Population covered, Intervention,  Comparator, Outcome) questions. The experts formulated recommendations and  formally graded them at a consensus meeting with input from patient  representatives and a voting panel of nephrologists representing all regions of  the world. Genetic diagnostics comprising joint analysis of COL4A3/4/5 genes is  already the key diagnostic test during the initial evaluation of an individual  presenting with persistent haematuria, proteinuria, kidney failure of unknown  origin, focal segmental sclerosis of unknown origin, and possibly cystic kidney  disease. Early renin-angiotensin system blockade is the standard of care therapy;  sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors may be added in adults with proteinuria  and chronic kidney disease. Relatives with heterozygous COL4A3/4/5 variants  should only be considered as the last possible resource for living kidney  donation. This guideline provides guidance for the diagnosis and management of  individuals with pathogenic variants in COL4A3/4/5 genes.",

abstract="PURPOSE: Understanding test-retest variability (TRV) of mesopic microperimetry is  critical for defining meaningful treatment effects in retinitis pigmentosa (RP)  trials. This study uniquely evaluates intra- and intervisit TRV and coefficients  of repeatability (CoRs) for microperimetry parameters in RP patients with varying  best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) levels. METHODS: In this single-centre  prospective cohort study, RP patients were assessed on two visits, 14.0{\thinspace}days  apart. Patients were grouped by BCVA: low (≤20/50 Snellen; ≥0.4{\thinspace}logMAR) or  moderate (>20/50 Snellen; <0.4{\thinspace}logMAR). Using Bland-Altman analyses, the CoRs for  intra- and intervisit variability were determined for pointwise (dB), mean (dB),  and volume sensitivity (dB*deg(2)) on mesopic microperimetry. RESULTS: Intravisit  CoRs for mean, volume, and pointwise sensitivity were 1.7{\thinspace}dB, 353.2{\thinspace}dB*deg(2),  and 8.6{\thinspace}dB, respectively, in the low-BCVA group (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}32), and 0.9{\thinspace}dB,  254.5{\thinspace}dB*deg(2), and 7.3{\thinspace}dB in the moderate-BCVA group (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}15). Intervisit CoRs  for mean, volume, and pointwise sensitivity were 2.4{\thinspace}dB, 355.2{\thinspace}dB*deg(2), and  10.2{\thinspace}dB in the low-BCVA group (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}31). The moderate-BCVA group (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}16) showed  smaller CoRs of 1.6{\thinspace}dB, 386.8{\thinspace}dB*deg(2), and 7.7{\thinspace}dB for mean, volume, and  pointwise sensitivity. BCVA and mean sensitivity, but not fixation stability, are  predictors of TRV for volume sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: Due to significant TRV,  pointwise sensitivity is an unreliable endpoint for RP patients, irrespective of  BCVA. Mean sensitivity is suitable as an endpoint when BCVA is relatively  preserved. Volume sensitivity provides additional spatial information, and shows  promise as a clinical endpoint for assessing macular sensitivity changes on  mesopic microperimetry in patients with RP.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to provide a large, multi-center normative  dataset for the Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA) microperimeter and compare  the goodness-of-fit and prediction interval calibration-error for a panel of  hill-of-vision models. METHODS: Microperimetry examinations of healthy eyes from  five independent study groups and one previously available dataset were included  (1137 tests from 531 eyes of 432 participants [223 women and 209 men]). Linear  mixed models (LMMs) were fitted to the data to obtain interpretable  hill-of-vision models. A panel of regression models to predict normative data was  compared using cross-validation with site-wise splits. The mean absolute error  (MAE) and miscalibration area (area between the calibration curve and the ideal  diagonal) were evaluated as the performance measures. RESULTS: Based on the  parameters ``participant age,'' ``eccentricity from the fovea,'' ``overlap with the  central fixation target,'' and ``eccentricity along the four principal meridians,''  a Bayesian mixed model had the lowest MAE (2.13 decibel [dB]; 95{\%} confidence  interval [CI] = 1.9-2.36 dB) and miscalibration area (0.13; 95{\%} CI = 0.07-0.19).  However, a parsimonious linear model provided a comparable MAE (2.17 dB; 95{\%} CI =  1.93-2.4 dB) and a similar miscalibration area (0.14; 95{\%} CI = 0.08-0.2).  CONCLUSIONS: Normal variations in visual sensitivity on mesopic microperimetry  can be effectively explained by a linear model that includes age and  eccentricity. The dataset and a code vignette are provided for estimating  normative values across a large range of retinal locations, applicable to  customized testing patterns.",

The iAMD incorporates a  broad spectrum of manifestations, which range from individual small drusen,  hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation up to early stages of geographical atrophy.  Current high-resolution imaging technologies enable an accurate detection and  description of anatomical features, such as drusen volumes, hyperreflexive foci  and photoreceptor degeneration, which are risk factors that are decisive for  prediction of the course of the disease; however, the manual annotation of these  features in complex optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans is impractical for  the routine clinical practice and research. In this context AI provides a  solution by fully automatic segmentation and therefore delivers exact,  reproducible and quantitative analyses of AMD-related biomarkers. Furthermore,  the application of AI in iAMD facilitates the risk assessment and the development  of structural endpoints for new forms of treatment. For example, the quantitative  analysis of drusen volume and hyperreflective foci with AI algorithms has shown a  correlation with the progression of the disease. These technological advances  therefore improve not only the diagnostic precision but also support future  targeted treatment strategies and contribute to the prioritized target of  personalized medicine in the diagnostics and treatment of AMD.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To understand the microperimetry response characteristics of regions  with a truly nonresponding location, which will be useful when considering  criteria for end-stage atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS:  A simulation model was developed using data from 128 participants with bilateral  large drusen at baseline seen over 36 months at 6-month intervals. One hundred  thousand pairs of real-world microperimetry testing results were simulated  separately with and without one truly nonresponding location, where the  sensitivity of one randomly selected location for the former group was derived  from the distribution of responses from a truly nonresponding location at the  optic nerve head from 60 healthy participants. RESULTS: Only 60{\%} of the simulated  test pairs with a truly nonresponding location had ≥1 location that was <0  decibel (dB) on both tests. In contrast, 91{\%} of the simulated test pairs had ≥1  location that was ≤10 dB on both tests, and 87{\%} had ≥1 location that was ≤10 dB  on both tests and <0 dB for one of the tests. Of the simulated test pairs without  a truly nonresponding location, there were 0.04{\%}, 1.4{\%}, and 0.4{\%} that met these  three above criteria, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Regions with a truly  nonresponding test location do not almost always show a repeatable absolute  scotoma (<0 dB), but instead, much more often a deep visual sensitivity defect  (≤10 dB), with or without having an absolute scotoma on one of the tests. These  findings are crucial if functional criteria are to be considered as part of a  definition of end-stage atrophic AMD.",

abstract="Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel) is a chronic, progressive disease of the  central retina characterized by vascular and neurodegenerative changes. As there  is currently no treatment for non-neovascular MacTel, there is a dearth for  biomarkers identifying eyes with an increased risk for disease progression for  patient counseling and clinical trial recruitment. Eyes were classified to be  stable or progressive, defined by the fundus photography-based grading system by  Gass and Blodi. First, structural differences between these two groups were  assessed, employing optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography.  Univariate regression analyses revealed evidence towards a lower superficial  retinal layer (SRL) vessel density (VD), skeleton density (SD) and deep retinal  layer (DRL) SD in progressing compared to stable eyes (p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.05, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.05,  p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.07). Second, a multivariable predictive model was employed to examine the  predictive value of structural and functional parameters for disease progression.  Baseline best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and SRL SD are prognostic for  disease progression (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.05). The presence of ellipsoid zone (EZ)  loss is prognostic for future central retinal thickness (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.01). We propose  SRL SD, BCVA, and EZ loss as prognostic biomarkers and as possible outcome  measures in future interventional studies in MacTel.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to evaluate retinal sensitivity in  subfields and its association with the novel quantitative contrast sensitivity  function (qCSF) in patients with early age-related macular degeneration (eAMD),  in patients with intermediate AMD (iAMD), and in healthy controls. METHODS: In  this prospective longitudinal study, retinal sensitivity of a customized 24-point  grid was assessed by microperimetry Macular Integrity Assessment (MAIA,  CenterVue, Padova, Italy) and divided into different subfields. The Multiple  Contrast Vision Meter (Adaptive Sensory Technology, San Diego, CA, USA) was used  for qCSF testing. Linear models were used to test the association of functional  metrics with variables of interest. RESULTS: 92 study eyes from 92 participants  were analyzed (13 eAMD, 31 iAMD, and 48 controls). Microperimetry subfield  comparison showed significant differences (p {\&}lt; 0.0001) in the control group  between superior and inferior hemifield as well as between central and peripheral  subfields. For eAMD, significant differences were found between central and  peripheral subfields (p {\&}lt; 0.001) and specific subfields (p {\&}lt; 0.05) and  finally for iAMD between specific quadrants (p {\&}lt; 0.05) and specific squares (p  {\&}lt; 0.05). Significant associations of retinal sensitivity with qCSF metrics  were found for the area underneath the logarithmic contrast sensitivity function,  contrast acuity and for the contrast sensitivity at specific spatial frequencies.  CONCLUSIONS: This study showed significant differences in the evaluated retinal  sensitivity subfields, providing localized natural history data for retinal  sensitivity in healthy controls and patients with eAMD and iAMD.",

abstract="Background/Objectives: To assess the frequency, extent, localization and  potential progression of optic disc drusen (ODD) and the correlation with the  angioid streak (AS) length and retinal atrophy in patients with pseudoxanthoma  elasticum (PXE). Methods: This retrospective study included patient data from a  dedicated PXE clinic at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn,  Germany (observation period from February 2008 to July 2023). Two readers  evaluated the presence, localization, and the extent of the ODD on fundus  autofluorescence (FAF) imaging at baseline and the follow-up assessments.  Additionally, we measured the length of the longest AS visible at baseline and  follow-up and the area of atrophy at baseline, both on FAF. Results: A total of  150 eyes of 75 PXE patients (median age at baseline 51.8 years, IRQ 46.3; 57.5  years, 49 female) underwent retrospective analysis. At baseline, 23 of 75  patients exhibited ODD in a minimum of one eye, resulting in an ODD prevalence of  30.7{\%} in our cohort of PXE patients. Among these, 14 patients showed monocular  and 9 binocular ODD that were localized predominantly nasally (46.9{\%}). During the  observational period (mean 97.5 {\textpm} 44.7 months), only one patient developed de  novo ODD in one eye and one other patient showed a progression in the size of the  existing ODD. The group of patients with ODD had significantly longer ASs (median  7020 {\textmu}m, IQR 4604; 9183, vs. AS length without ODD: median 4404 {\textmu}m, IQR 3512;  5965, p < 0.001). No association with the size of the atrophy was found at  baseline (p = 0.27). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a prevalence of ODD of  30.7{\%}. ODD presence is associated with longer ASs (an indicator of the severity  and extent of ocular Bruch's membrane calcification), suggesting that ODD  formation is tightly related to ectopic calcification-possibly secondary to  calcification of the lamina cribrosa. Prospective studies investigating the  impact of ODD (in conjunction with intraocular pressure) on visual function in  PXE warrant consideration.",

abstract="Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal-recessively inherited multisystem  disease. Mutations in the ABCC6-gene are causative, coding for a transmembrane  transporter mainly expressed in hepatocytes, which promotes the efflux of  adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This results in low levels of plasma inorganic  pyrophosphate (PPi), a critical anti-mineralization factor. The clinical  phenotype of PXE is characterized by the effects of elastic fiber calcification  in the skin, the cardiovascular system, and the eyes. In the eyes, calcification  of Bruch's membrane results in clinically visible lesions, including peau  d'orange, angioid streaks, and comet tail lesions. Frequently, patients must be  treated for secondary macular neovascularization. No effective therapy is  available for treating the cause of PXE, but several promising approaches are  emerging. Finding appropriate outcome measures remains a significant challenge  for clinical trials in this slowly progressive disease. This review article  provides an in-depth summary of the current understanding of PXE and its  multi-systemic manifestations. The article offers a detailed overview of the  ocular manifestations, including their morphological and functional consequences,  as well as potential complications.

abstract="BACKGROUND: Retinal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence (FAF), strongly  depends on the clearness of the optical media. Lens status is crucial since the  ageing lens has both light-blocking and autofluorescence (AF) properties that  distort image analysis. Here, we report both lens opacification and AF metrics  and the effect on automated image quality assessment. METHODS: 227 subjects  (range: 19-89 years old) received quantitative AF of the lens (LQAF),  Scheimpflug, anterior chamber optical coherence tomography as well as blue/green  FAF (BAF/GAF), and infrared (IR) imaging. LQAF values, the Pentacam Nucleus  Staging score and the relative lens reflectivity were extracted to estimate lens  opacification. Mean opinion scores of FAF and IR image quality were compiled by  medical readers. A regression model for predicting image quality was developed  using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Correlation analysis was conducted to  assess the association of lens scores, with retinal image quality derived from  human or CNN annotations. RESULTS: Retinal image quality was generally high  across all imaging modalities (IR (8.25{\textpm}1.99) >GAF >BAF (6.6{\textpm}3.13)). CNN image  quality prediction was excellent (average mean absolute error (MAE) 0.9).  Predictions were comparable to human grading. Overall, LQAF showed the highest  correlation with image quality grading criteria for all imaging modalities (eg,  Pearson correlation{\textpm}CI -0.35 (-0.50 to 0.18) for BAF/LQAF). BAF image quality was  most vulnerable to an increase in lenticular metrics, while IR (-0.19 (-0.38 to  0.01)) demonstrated the highest resilience. CONCLUSION: The use of CNN-based  retinal image quality assessment achieved excellent results. The study highlights  the vulnerability of BAF to lenticular remodelling. These results can aid in the  development of cut-off values for clinical studies, ensuring reliable data  collection for the monitoring of retinal diseases.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the onset, treatment frequency, and visual outcome of  anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment due to secondary  choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum  (PXE). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study METHODS: One-hundred six eyes of 53  patients with PXE were analyzed. The assessment of CNV activity relied on  hemorrhage visible on funduscopy and intra- / subretinal fluid on optical  coherence tomography (OCT), individually defining a shortening or extension of  treatment interval. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, age at  anti-VEGF therapy initiation, and BCVA-drop events at exudation onset (worsening  of BCVA of 2 or more lines) were documented. Further, we assessed the number of  injections during the first year and the total number of injections, the time to  treatment initiation of the fellow eye, and BCVA over time. RESULTS: During a  median observation period of 77 months (IQR 49; 126) patients received a median  number of 28.0 anti-VEGF-injections (IQR 9.8; 43.5). Eight patients received no  injection (median age at baseline 38.1 years), 11 patients underwent anti-VEGF  treatment in one eye (median age 47.2 years) and 34 patients in both eyes (median  age 51.8 years). The median age at the first anti-VEGF treatment was 52.80 years  (IQR 47.2-57.6). Applying Cox regression models, the median ``survival'' time of  fellow eye until treatment initiation was 16.8 months. In the group of bilateral  treated patients, the median time difference was 9.6 months (IQR 2.1- 32.4, range  0-122) The median number of injections was 5.5 per eye in the first year of  treatment (IQR 3-7) and was associated with the total number of injections in the  observation period (2.33, CI 1.22-3.44, P < .001). A better BCVA at the last  follow-up visit was associated with a better baseline BCVA (P < .001, R(2) =  0.318) and with the absence of a BCVA drop at the onset of exudation (P = 0.035,  R(2) = 0.339). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that anti-VEGF  treatment is required for most PXE patients at a relatively young age. Once  treatment in one eye is initiated, the time to fellow eye treatment is relatively  short. A BCVA drop before treatment initiation is a risk factor for worse visual  outcomes, suggesting that treatment is prudent before exudation affects the  central retina. Given the young age of onset and intensive treatment needs,  patients with PXE might particularly benefit from longer-acting anti-VEGF  therapeutics.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To describe imaging features of macular telangiectasia type 2 eyes  experiencing ellipsoid zone (EZ) recovery. METHODS: Macular telangiectasia type 2  patients with EZ recovery were identified from the Natural History and  Observational Registry study and underwent retinal imaging including optical  coherence tomography and fundus photography. Eyes were graded according to the  classification system by Gass and Blodi, the EZ-loss area was measured, and  optical coherence tomography parameters were assessed by two independent readers.  Parameters were analyzed for their presence before EZ recovery. RESULTS:  Twenty-four eyes of 21 patients (12 female, 57.12{\%}; mean age 68 {\textpm} 8.54 years)  were included in this study and followed for 21.25 months {\textpm} 12.79 months. At  baseline, mean EZ-loss area was 0.036 mm 2 {\textpm} 0.028 mm 2 and 0.01 mm 2 {\textpm} 0.013 mm  2 at follow-up ( P < 0.001). A persisting external limiting membrane overlaying  the EZ-loss was detected in 16 cases (66{\%}), and hyperreflective changes in the  outer retina were present in 18 cases (75{\%}). Best-corrected visual acuity was  0.23 (20/32) {\textpm} 0.33 logMAR at baseline and 0.34 (20/40) {\textpm} 0.34 logMAR at  follow-up ( P = 0.3). CONCLUSION: Distinct optical coherence tomography features  precede ellipsoid zone recovery in macular telangiectasia type 2 and warrant  further studies investigating implications for patient care and clinical trial  interpretation.",

abstract="PURPOSE: Quantitative fundus autofluorescence (QAF) currently deploys an  age-based score to correct for lens opacification. However, in elderly people,  lens opacification varies strongly between individuals of similar age, and innate  lens autofluorescence is not included in the current correction formula. Our goal  was to develop and compare an individualized formula. METHODS: One hundred thirty  participants were examined cross-sectionally, and a subset of 30 participants  received additional multimodal imaging 2-week post-cataract-surgery. Imaging  included the Scheimpflug principle, anterior chamber optical coherence tomography  (AC-OCT), lens quantitative autofluorescence (LQAF), and retinal QAF imaging.  Among the subset, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression and  backward selection was implemented to determine which lens score best predicts  the QAF value after lens extraction. Subsequently, a spline mixed model was  applied to the whole cohort to quantify the influence of LQAF and Scheimpflug on  QAF. RESULTS: Age and LQAF measurements were found to be the most relevant  variables, whereas AC-OCT measurements and Scheimpflug were eliminated by  backward selection. Both an increase in Scheimpflug and LQAF values were  associated with a decrease in QAF. The prediction error of the spline model (mean  absolute error [MAE] {\textpm} standard deviation) of 32.2 {\textpm} 23.4 (QAF a.u.) was markedly  lower compared to the current age-based formula MAE of 96.1 {\textpm} 93.5. Both smooth  terms, LQAF (P < 0.01) and Scheimpflug (P < 0.001), were significant for the  spline mixed model. CONCLUSIONS: LQAF imaging proved to be the most predictive  for the impact of the natural lens on QAF imaging. The application of lens scores  in the clinic could improve the accuracy of QAF imaging interpretation and might  allow including aged patients in future QAF studies.",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to determine how structural and  functional parameters influence the vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in  patients suffering from geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular  degeneration. DESIGN: This study was designed as a prospective,  noninterventional, natural-history study (Directional Spread in  Geographic-Atrophy study, NCT02051998). SUBJECTS: The research involved 82  patients with bilateral GA. METHODS: The study examined parameters including GA  location as assessed by the ETDRS grid, best-corrected visual acuity,  low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed. These parameters  were then correlated with VRQoL, which was gauged using the National Eye  Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25. The analysis method employed was the  least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with linear mixed-effects models.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The central parameters measured in this study encompassed  GA area, VRQoL scores associated with different GA subfields, and the  significance of LLVA for foveal-sparing patients. RESULTS: On average, patients  showed a total GA area of 2.9 {\textpm} 1.2 mm(2) in the better eye (BE) and 3.1 {\textpm} 1.3  mm(2) in the worse eye. The most significant associations with VRQoL scores for  distance and near activities were observed in the inner lower and inner left  subfields of the BE, respectively. For patients with foveal-sparing GA, the LLVA  of the BE stood out as the most influential variable across all VRQoL scales.  CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings point toward the pivotal role of GA location,  especially the inner lower and inner left subfields of the BE, in relation to  VRQoL in GA patients. The LLVA's importance becomes even more pronounced for  foveal-sparing patients. These observations highlight the need for health care  professionals to better understand the association between lesion location and  patient-reported outcomes. This is critical for informing treatment decisions and  refining the planning of interventional trials.

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the spatial distribution of reticular pseudodrusen (RPD)  in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and their correlation with  functional measures, retinal thickness, and changes over time. DESIGN:  Longitudinal, cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five participants with RPD and  spectrum of AMD severity (including no AMD). METHODS: Multimodal imaging was  graded by a reading center, including evaluation of color fundus imaging to  assess AMD severity scores. Reticular pseudodrusen presence on OCT volumes was  confirmed on en face imaging and the RPD extent was contoured on infrared images.  One study eye per participant underwent rod-mediated dark adaptation, measuring  rod intercept time (RIT) at 5{\textdegree} and, if needed, 12{\textdegree} superior to the fovea. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was RIT and OCT thickness measures which  were correlated with RPD area. RESULTS: A total of 51 eyes had ≥ 1 visit with RPD  detected (mean follow-up, 2.19 {\textpm} 2.04 years; range, 0-5 years), totaling 169  eye-based visits with RPD. Of the 51 eyes with RPD, 5 (9.8{\%}) developed geographic  atrophy and 17 (33.3{\%}) progressed to neovascular AMD. Larger RPD areas were  detected more frequently in AMD severity scores 6-7. Reticular pseudodrusen area  within an eye generally increased over time. The lesion distribution showed a  predilection for the superior retina, especially the outer superior subfield of  the ETDRS grid, with the central subfield having least involvement. Reticular  pseudodrusen area was inversely correlated with central subfield thickness and  positively correlated with RIT at 5{\textdegree} (P = 0.001; r(2) = 0.01) and 12{\textdegree} (P = 0.004;  r(2) = 0.01). Rod-mediated dark adaptation at 5{\textdegree} reached the test ceiling in >  85{\%} of visits, irrespective of RPD lesion presence/absence at the test location.  Retinal thickness decreased monotonically, with the central subfield  demonstrating the greatest percentage change over 5 years ($\Delta$ = -5.47{\%}).  CONCLUSIONS: In AMD, RPD involve predominantly the superior retina but can  involve all ETDRS subfields and evolve over time. Eyes with RPD exhibit  structural and functional impairments that can be measured beyond the boundaries  of the RPD lesions, suggesting changes associated with RPD are associated with  both local changes and a more widespread process.

METHODS: We developed a custom  dark-adaptometry software for the S-MAIA device using the  open-perimetry-interface. In the validation-substudy, participants underwent  dark-adaptometry testing with a comparator device (MonCvONE, 59{\%} rhodopsin  bleach, cyan and red stimuli centered at 2 degrees, 4 degrees, and 6 degrees  eccentricity). Following a brief break (approximately 5 minutes), the  participants were bleached again and underwent dark-adaptometry testing with the  S-MAIA device (same loci). In the retest reliability-substudy, participants were  tested twice with the S-MAIA device (same loci as above). Nonlinear curve fitting  was applied to extract dark-adaptation curve parameters. Validity and  repeatability were summarized in terms of the mean bias and 95{\%} limits of  agreement (LoAs). RESULTS: In the validation-substudy (N = 20 participants,  median age interquartile range [IQR] 31.5 years [IQR = 25.8, 62.0]), measures of  rod-mediated dark-adaptation showed little to no between method differences for  the cone-rod-break-time (bias 95{\%} confidence interval [95{\%} CI] of +0.1 minutes  [95{\%} CI = -0.6 to 0.8]), rod-intercept-time (-0.23 minutes [95{\%} CI = -1.38 to  0.93]), and S2 slope (-0.01 LogUnits/minutes [95{\%} CI = -0.02 to -0.01]). In the  retest reliability-substudy (N = 10 participants, 32.0 years [95{\%} CI = 27.0,  57.5]), the corresponding LoAs were (cone-rod-break-time) -3.94 to 2.78 minutes,  (rod-intercept-time) -4.55 to 3.11 minutes, and (S2 slope [rate-limited component  of rod recovery]) -0.03 to 0.03 LogUnits/minutes. The LoAs for the steady-state  cone and rod thresholds were -0.28 to 0.33 LogUnits and -0.34 to 0.28 LogUnits.  CONCLUSIONS: The devised fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry method yields valid  and reliable results. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry  solves the critical need for localized testing of the visual cycle and retinoid  transfer in eyes with unstable fixation.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to describe the design and the  participants' baseline characteristics of a prospective natural history study of  geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. METHODS:  The optical coherence tomography (OCT) and microperimetry biomarker evaluation in  patients with GA (OMEGA) study was conducted at a tertiary referral center  (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT05963646). Participants were followed for 12  months during 4 visits (baseline and follow-up exams at weeks 12, 24, and 48)  with best-corrected Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study visual acuity,  low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), and quick contrast sensitivity function  testing. Further, participants underwent spectral-domain OCT, OCT angiography,  fundus autofluorescence imaging, and mesopic microperimetry testing. RESULTS:  Thirty participants (median [IQR] age of 79 [77, 84] years) and 37 study eyes  were included with a (median [IQR]) GA area of 1.40 mm2 (0.49, 5.24) at baseline.  Out of 37 study eyes, six developed macular neovascularizations (16{\%}). The  study-eye best-corrected visual acuity was (median [IQR]) 0.18 logarithm of the  minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) (0.06, 0.26), LLVA 0.66 logMAR (0.36, 0.88),  and the microperimetry mean sensitivity 18.4 dB (9.21, 20.9). The highest  correlation between square root GA area and a visual function test was evident  for LLVA (R2 of 0.578), followed by area under the log contrast sensitivity  function curve (0.519) and microperimetral retinal sensitivity (0.487).  CONCLUSION: This report lays out the design and baseline characteristics of the  OMEGA study, which aims to contribute to the understanding of the natural history  of GA. The OMEGA study will provide estimates of the ability to detect change and  retest reliability for a panel of structure and functional assessments.",

Recently, two therapies have been approved by the US FDA. However, given the  nature of their treatment effect, which primarily involves a relative decrease in  disease progression, discerning the individual treatment response at the  individual level may not be readily apparent. Thus, clinical decision-making may  have to rely on the quantification of the slope of GA progression before and  during treatment. A panel of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence  (AI)-based algorithms are available for such quantifications.

Despite the tremendous success of DL, due to  human judgment, these ground truth labels can be inaccurate and/or ambiguous and  cause a human selection bias. We therefore investigated the impact of the size of  the ground truth and variable numbers of graders on the predictive performance of  the same DL architecture and repeated each experiment three times. The largest  training dataset delivered a prediction performance close to that of human  experts. All DL systems utilized were highly consistent. Nevertheless, the DL  under-performers could not achieve any further autonomous improvement even after  repeated training. Furthermore, a quantifiable linear relationship between ground  truth ambiguity and the beneficial effect of having a larger amount of ground  truth data was detected and marked as the more-ground-truth effect.",

abstract="BACKGROUND/AIMS: The primary objective was to determine how structural and  functional parameters influence the vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in  patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular  degeneration (AMD). METHODS: This prospective, non-interventional,  natural-history 'Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy' study was conducted at  the University Eye Hospital in Bonn, enrolling 82 patients with bilateral GA.  Parameters such as GA location (assessed by the Early Treatment Diabetic  Retinopathy Study grid), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance  visual acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed were examined. The association  between these parameters and VRQoL, as gauged using the National Eye Institute  Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25), was analyzed through least  absolute shrinkage and selection operator with linear mixed-effects models.  RESULTS: The average total GA area observed was 2.9 {\textpm} 1.2 mm(2) (better eye) and  3.1 {\textpm} 1.3 mm(2) (worse eye). The VRQoL scores for distance and near activities  were most associated with the inner lower and inner left subfields of the better  eye. For foveal-sparing patients, the LLVA of the better eye was the predominant  determinate impacting all VRQoL scales. CONCLUSION: GA location, specifically the  inner lower and inner left subfields of the better eye, has a notable effect on  VRQoL in GA patients. LLVA stands out as especially vital in foveal-sparing  patients, underscoring the importance for clinicians to incorporate  considerations of GA location and functional parameters into their risk-benefit  assessments for emerging treatments.",

The Visual Field  Modeling and Analysis (VFMA) software and an open-source implementation (OSI)  were applied to calculate MP-derived hill-of-vison (HOV) surface plots and the  total volume (VTOT) beneath the plots. Bland-Altman plots were used for  methodologic comparison, and the association of retinal sensitivity metrics with  explanatory variables was tested with mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In total,  247 eyes of 189 participants (75 {\textpm} 7.3 years) were included in the analysis. The  VTOT output of VFMA and OSI exhibited a significant difference (P < 0.0001). VFMA  yielded slightly higher coefficients of determination than OSI and mean  sensitivity (MS) in univariable and multivariable modeling, for example, in  association with low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA) (marginal R2/conditional R2:  VFMA 0.171/0.771, OSI 0.162/0.765, MS 0.133/0.755). In the multivariable  analysis, LLVA was the only demonstrable predictor of VFMA VTOT (t-value,  P-value: -7.5, <0.001) and MS (-6.5, <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The HOV-derived metric  of VTOT exhibits favorable characteristics compared to MS in evaluating retinal  sensitivity. The output of VFMA and OSI is not exactly interchangeable in this  cross-sectional analysis. Longitudinal analysis is necessary to assess their  performance in ability-to-detect change. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: This study  explores new volumetric MP endpoints for future application in therapeutic trials  in iAMD and reports specific characteristics of the available HOV software  applications.",

abstract="OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability to evaluate changes over time of individual  lesions of incomplete or complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and outer  retinal atrophy (iRORA and cRORA, respectively) in patients with intermediate  age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: OCT images from patients  enrolled in Proxima B clinical trial (NCT02399072) were utilized. PARTICIPANTS:  Patients enrolled in the Proxima B clinical trial, from the cohort with  geographic atrophy (GA) in 1 eye and iAMD in the other eye at baseline, were  included. METHODS: Junior and senior readers analyzed OCT images for the  qualitative presence of 9 distinct early atrophic features (presence of zone of  choroidal hypertransmission, attenuation and/or disruption of RPE, disruption of  ellipsoid zone [EZ] and external limiting membrane [ELM], outer nuclear layer  [ONL] thinning, outer plexiform layer [OPL]/inner nuclear layer [INL] subsidence,  and hyporeflective wedge-shaped band). If deemed ``present,'' 7 features were  quantified with a predefined tolerance level of 50 $\mu$m (diameter for the zone of  choroidal hypertransmission, zone of attenuation and/or disruption of the RPE,  outer retinal thickness left/right vertical diameter, outer retinal thickness  thinnest vertical diameter, annotation of EZ, and ELM disruption). MAIN OUTCOME  MEASURES: Interreader agreements for qualitative assessments ($\kappa$-type statistics)  and quantitative measurements (Bland-Altman statistics) were assessed.  Progression of the lesion features over time was described. RESULTS: Moderate  agreement was found for presence of choroidal hypertransmission ($\kappa$ = 0.54),  followed by ELM disruption ($\kappa$ = 0.58), OPL/INL subsidence ($\kappa$ = 0.46), and a  hyporeflective wedge-shaped band ($\kappa$ = 0.47). Quantification measurements showed  that choroidal hypertransmission had the highest agreement, whereas RPE  attenuation/disruption had the lowest agreement. Longitudinal adjudicated changes  for quantitative measurements of lesion progression showed that choroidal  hypertransmission and ELM disruption showed significant progression, whereas EZ  disruption and RPE attenuation/disruption did not. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to  evaluate changes over time for specific features of iRORA and cRORA was explored.  The most robust biomarker was found to be choroidal hypertransmission, followed  by ELM disruption and the qualitative markers of OPL/INL subsidence, as well as a  wedge-shaped band. Disease progression over time could be assessed by some, but  not all, spectral-domain OCT features that were explored.

abstract="Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the most common inherited retina degeneration. It is  caused by biallelic ABCA4 variants, and no treatment is available to date. STGD1  shows marked phenotypic variability, especially regarding the age of onset. The  underlying genotype can partially explain this variability. Notably, a subset of  ABCA4 variants was previously associated with an earlier disease onset than  truncating ABCA4 variants, pointing toward pathogenic mechanisms beyond the loss  of gene function in these patients. On the other end of the spectrum, variants  such as p.Gly1961Glu were associated with markedly slower extrafoveal disease  progression. Given that these drastic differences in phenotype are based on  genotype (resulting in important prognostic implications for patients), this  chapter reviews previous approaches to genotype-phenotype correlation analyses in  STGD1.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the functional impact of oral  vitamin A supplementation in patients with intermediate age-related macular  degeneration with and without reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) demonstrating  dysfunction in dark adaptation. METHODS: Five patients with intermediate  age-related macular degeneration and without RPD (AMD group; mean {\textpm} SD age 78.0 {\textpm}  4.7 years) and seven with RPD (RPD group; age 74.1 {\textpm} 11.2 years) were  supplemented with 16,000 IU of vitamin A palmitate for 8 weeks. Assessment at  baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks included scotopic thresholds, dark adaptation,  best-corrected and low luminance visual acuities, and the low-luminance quality  of life questionnaire. RESULTS: In the linear mixed model, rod intercept time  improved significantly in the AMD group (mean [95{\%} CI] change -1.1 minutes [-1.8;  -0.5] after 4 weeks ( P < 0.001) and -2.2 min [-2.9 to -1.6] after 8 weeks of  vitamin A supplementation ( P < 0.001). The dark adaptation cone plateau also  significantly improved (i.e., more sensitive cone threshold) at 4 and 8 weeks ( P  = 0.026 and P = 0.001). No other parameters improved in the AMD group, and there  was no significant improvement in any parameter in the RPD group despite  significantly elevated serum vitamin A levels measurable in both groups after  supplementation ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Supplementation with  16,000 IU vitamin A, a lower dose than used in previous studies, partially  overcomes the pathophysiologic functional changes in AMD eyes. The lack of  improvement in the RPD group may indicate structural impediments to increasing  vitamin A availability in these patients and/or may reflect the higher  variability observed in the functional parameters for this group.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To systematically assess the ability to detect change and retest  reliability for a panel of visual function assessments in ABCA4 retinopathy.  DESIGN: Prospective natural history study (NCT01736293). METHODS: Patients with  at least 1 documented pathogenic ABCA4 variant and a clinical phenotype  consistent with ABCA4 retinopathy were recruited from a tertiary referral center.  Participants underwent longitudinal, multifaceted functional testing, including  measures of function at fixation (best-corrected visual acuity, low-vision  Cambridge Color Test), macular function (microperimetry), and retina-wide  function (full-field electroretinography [ERG]). Two- and 5-year ability to  detect change was determined based on the $\eta$(2) statistic. RESULTS: A total of 134  eyes from 67 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.65 years were included. In  the 2-year interval, the microperimetry-derived perilesional sensitivity ($\eta$(2) of  0.73 [0.53, 0.83]; -1.79 dB/y [-2.2, -1.37]) and mean sensitivity ($\eta$(2) of 0.62  [0.38, 0.76]; -1.28 dB/y [-1.67, -0.89]) showed most change over time, but could  only be recorded in 71.6{\%} of the participants. In the 5-year interval, the  dark-adapted ERG a- and b-wave amplitude showed marked change over time as well  (eg, DA 30 a-wave amplitude with an $\eta$(2) of 0.54 [0.34, 0.68]; -0.02  log(10)({\textmu}V)/y [-0.02, -0.01]). The genotype explained a large fraction of  variability in the ERG-based age of disease initiation (adjusted R(2) of 0.73)  CONCLUSIONS: Microperimetry-based clinical outcome assessments were most  sensitive to change but could only be acquired in a subset of participants.  Across a 5-year interval, the ERG DA 30 a-wave amplitude was sensitive to disease  progression, potentially allowing for more inclusive clinical trial designs  encompassing the whole ABCA4 retinopathy spectrum.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To quantify choriocapillaris flow alterations in patients with  pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) in pre-atrophic stages and its association with  structural changes of the choroid and outer retina. METHODS: Thirty-two eyes of  21 patients with PXE and 35 healthy eyes of 35 controls were included. The  density of choriocapillaris flow signal deficits (FDs) was quantified on 6 {\texttimes} 6-mm  optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Spectral-domain optical  coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images were analyzed for thicknesses of the choroid  and outer retinal microstructure and correlated with choriocapillaris FDs in the  respective Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study subfield. RESULTS: The  multivariable mixed model analysis for choriocapillaris FDs revealed  significantly higher FDs associated with the group (PXE patients vs. controls  +13.6; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 9.87-17.3; P < 0.001), with increasing age  (+0.22{\%} per year; 95{\%} CI 0.12-0.33; P < 0.001), and with retinal location  (significantly higher FDs in nasal compared to temporal subfields). Choroidal  thickness (CT) did not differ significantly between both groups (P = 0.078). The  CT and choriocapillaris FDs were inversely correlated (-1.92 {\textmu}m per {\%}FDs;  interquartile range -2.81 to -1.03; P < 0.001). Larger values of the  choriocapillaris FDs were associated with significant thinning of the overlying  photoreceptor layers (outer segments: -0.21 {\textmu}m per {\%}FDs, P < 0.001; inner  segments: -0.12 {\textmu}m per {\%}FDs, P = 0.001; outer nuclear layer: -0.72 {\textmu}m per {\%}FDs; P  < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PXE display significant alterations of the  choriocapillaris on OCTA even in pre-atrophic stages and in the absence of  significant choroidal thinning. The analysis favors choriocapillaris FDs over  choroidal thickness as a potential early outcome measure for future  interventional trials in PXE. Further, increased FDs in nasal compared to  temporal locations mirror the centrifugal spread of Bruch's membrane  calcification in PXE.",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare hereditary systemic  disease that results in alterations of the kidneys, inner ear, and various  structures of the eye. It is caused by mutations in one of the genes encoding  collagen type IV. In recent years, new and innovative imaging techniques have  added characteristics of ocular alterations in AS and provided new insights,  including into the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of this paper is to  provide an overview of the current knowledge of ocular changes in AS, as well as  to present the Alport ocular pass. METHOD: Narrative review article. RESULTS:  Ocular manifestations of AS include changes in the cornea, lens, and retina.  Specifically, posterior polymorphic corneal dystrophy, anterior lenticonus  (pathognomonic for AS), and various retinal changes have been described, which  have been further characterized in recent years by newer imaging techniques. In  particular, foveal changes in AS may present as both a thickened central retina  in the context of foveal hypoplasia or a staircase-like thinning of the fovea.  Both lesions could provide further insights into the role of type IV collagen in  ocular structures. CONCLUSION: The AS can manifest in various structures of the  eye. The staircase-like changes of the central retina in AS patients indicate the  important role of collagen type IV in the homeostasis and regular function of the  inner retinal layers. The often mild foveal hypoplasia may provide clues to the  role of collagen type IV in retinal embryogenesis. While anterior lenticonus is  pathognomonic for AS and can be treated easily by refractive lens exchange, the  only option currently available for retinal alterations is close follow-up and,  if necessary, treatment of systemic complications of AS.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The scotopic macular integrity assessment (S-MAIA) can perform scotopic  assessment to detect localized changes to scotopic rod and cone function. This  study is an exploratory investigation of the feasibility of using the S-MAIA in a  rod-cone dystrophy population to identify the pattern of loss in scotopic  photoreceptor function. METHODS: Twenty patients diagnosed with a rod-cone  dystrophy underwent visual acuity testing, full-field stimulus threshold  assessment, and multiple S-MAIA tests after dark adaptation periods of 20 minutes  and 45 minutes performed separately. Only right eyes were tested. Three tests  were performed following a learning test. A Bland-Altman analysis was used to  assess repeatability and agreement between tests after the two time periods.  Spatial interpolation maps were created from the group plots to display the  pattern of rod and cone loss. RESULTS: Learning effects took place between  testing sessions 1 and 2 but not 2 and 3. Limits of agreement were larger in the  patient eyes than control eyes, but within previously reported values. Using  longer adaptation time of 45 minutes did not offer a significant advantage over  20 minutes. Patterns for the cyan and red sensitivities were different,  indicating different patterns of loss for rods and cones. CONCLUSIONS: A dark  adaptation time of 20 minutes before testing is sufficient for thresholding. The  S-MAIA is suitable for use in patients with a logarithm of the minimum angle of  resolution vision of at least 0.7 and provides a viable outcome measure for  patients with rod-cone dystrophies and preserved central vision. The spatial  information about scotopic function from the S-MAIA provides information about  disease processes and progression. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: There is a need for  scotopic measures for use in clinical trials. Scotopic microperimetry works well  in patients with early disease, allowing the extension of recruitment criteria  for novel therapies of rod-cone dystrophies.",

SUBJECTS: Overall, 301 eyes of 301 subjects with early (n = 34),  intermediate (n = 168), and late AMD (n = 43), as well as eyes without any AMD  features (n = 56). METHODS: In study eyes with intermediate AMD (iAMD), the  presence of structural AMD biomarkers, including pigmentary abnormalities (PAs),  pigment epithelium detachment (PED), refractile deposits, reticular pseudodrusen  (RPD), hyperreflective foci (HRF), incomplete/complete retinal pigment epithelium  (RPE), and outer retinal atrophy (i/cRORA), and quiescent choroidal  neovascularization (qCNV) was systematically determined in the prospectively  acquired multimodal retinal imaging cross-sectional data set of MACUSTAR. Retinal  layer thicknesses and the RPE drusen complex (RPEDC) volume were determined for  the total study cohort in spectral-domain (SD) OCT imaging using a  deep-learning-based algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and topographic  distribution of structural iAMD features. RESULTS: A total of 301 study eyes of  301 subjects with a mean ({\textpm} standard deviation) age of 71.2 {\textpm} 7.20 years (63.1{\%}  women) were included. Besides large drusen, the most prevalent structural feature  in iAMD study eyes were PA (57.1{\%}), followed by HRF (51.8{\%}) and RPD (22.0{\%}).  Pigment epithelium detachment lesions were observed in 4.8{\%}, vitelliform lesions  in 4.2{\%}, refractile deposits in 3.0{\%}, and qCNV in 2.4{\%}. Direct precursor lesions  for manifest retinal atrophy were detected in 10.7{\%} (iRORA) and 4.2{\%} (cRORA) in  iAMD eyes. Overall, the highest RPEDC volume with a median of 98.92 {\texttimes} 10(-4) mm{\textthreesuperior}  was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial analysis demonstrated a predominant  distribution of RPD in the superior and temporal subfields at a foveal  eccentricity of 1.5 to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct  topographic distribution involving the foveal center. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed  knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD biomarkers is  vital to identify reliable outcome measure for disease progression. Longitudinal  analyses are needed to evaluate their prognostic value for conversion to advanced  disease stages.

We compared automated drusen  volume measurements between different OCT devices. We included 380 eyes from 200  individuals with bilateral intermediate (iAMD, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}126), early (eAMD, n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}25) or  no AMD (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}49) from the MACUSTAR study. We assessed OCT scans from Cirrus  (200{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}200 macular cube, 6{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}6 mm; Zeiss Meditec, CA) and Spectralis (20{\textdegree}{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}20{\textdegree},  25 B-scans; 30{\textdegree}{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}25{\textdegree}, 241 B-scans; Heidelberg Engineering, Germany) devices.  Sensitivity and specificity for drusen detection and differences between  modalities were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and  mean difference in a 5 mm diameter fovea-centered circle. Specificity was{\thinspace}>{\thinspace}90{\%}  in the three modalities. In eAMD, we observed highest sensitivity in the denser  Spectralis scan (68.1). The two different Spectralis modalities showed a  significantly higher agreement in quantifying drusen volume in iAMD (ICC 0.993  [0.991-0.994]) than the dense Spectralis with Cirrus scan (ICC 0.807  [0.757-0.847]). Formulae for drusen volume conversion in iAMD between the two  devices are provided. Automated drusen volume measures are not interchangeable  between devices and softwares and need to be interpreted with the used imaging  devices and software in mind. Accounting for systematic difference between  methods increases comparability and conversion formulae are provided. Less dense  scans did not affect drusen volume measurements in iAMD but decreased sensitivity  for medium drusen in eAMD.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03349801.

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate potential associations between renal function and  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) features as assessed with multimodal  retinal imaging. METHODS: A subset of participants included in a dark adaptation  study with varying AMD severities had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  values (mL/min/1.73 m2) obtained from renal function laboratory testing of serum  creatinine and cystatin C. Multimodal imaging from visit dates associated with  serum samples was graded by the Wisconsin Reading Center for AMD features.  Associations of eGFR with AMD features and severity grades, age, smoker status  and rod-intercept time were investigated. Simple univariate analyses,  age-corrected multivariate analyses, and a feature-selecting least absolute  shrinkage and selection operator regression were performed for eGFR as a  continuous dependent variable. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients (mean age, 75.1 {\textpm}  9.4 years; mean eGFR, 70.7 {\textpm} 18.2 mL/min/1.73 m2) were included. In univariate  analyses age (estimate, -1.16 units/year; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -1.46 to  -0.87; P < 0.0001), rod-intercept time (estimate, -0.54 units/minute; 95{\%} CI,  -0.81 to -0.27; P < 0.001) and subretinal drusenoid deposits (-11.12 units for  subretinal drusenoid deposit presence in either eye; 95{\%} CI, -20.23 to -2.01; P =  0.017) were associated with decreased renal function. However, in age-corrected  multivariate models, age was the only significant variable associated with renal  function, confirmed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator  regression. CONCLUSIONS: Accounting for age, renal function parameters did not  show an association with AMD features. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Bruch's membrane  of the eye and the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney share physiologic  similarities such that decreased renal function may demonstrate associations with  AMD phenotypes.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze presence of hyperreflective foci (HRF) across different  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severities and examine its correlation  with other structural and functional AMD features. DESIGN: Longitudinal,  single-center, case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty-eight  participants aged > 50 years old with varying AMD severities (including no AMD).  METHODS: Color fundus imaging was used to assess AMD severity and  hyperpigmentation (PGM) presence. Subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and HRF  were detected on OCT volumes. The correlations of HRF with additional AMD  features were evaluated using linear and logistic mixed-effects models. One study  eye per participant underwent dark adaptation (DA) testing to measure rod  intercept time (RIT) for structure function associations. Eyes were followed  longitudinally and changes in AMD severity and RIT were measured relative to HRF  presence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was presence of HRF, which  was compared with presence of other AMD features and DA impairment. RESULTS: One  hundred and fifty-eight participants (median baseline age of 73.1 [interquartile  range (IQR) = 66-79] years) contributing 1277 eye visits were included.  Hyperreflective foci (HRF) were detected more frequently in higher AMD  severities. Hyperreflective-foci presence was significantly associated with PGM  presence (odds ratio 832.9, P < 0.001) and SDD presence (odds ratio 9.42, P =  0.017). Eyes with HRF demonstrated significantly longer DA (median 27.1 [IQR =  16-40] minutes) than those without HRF (13.5 [10-22] minutes) but less than eyes  with SDD only (40 [28-40] minutes). Highest RIT values were found in eyes with  both HRF and SDD (40.0 [40-40] minutes). Age and HRF explained a similar  proportion of RIT variability as age and SDD. Eyes that developed HRF  demonstrated baseline RITs closer to eyes with HRF at baseline, compared with  eyes that never developed HRF (29.1 [16-40], 38.5 [22-40] versus 13.1 [10-22]  minutes; Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The progressively increased  presence of HRF in higher AMD severities, and its correlation with previously  associated AMD biomarkers, suggests HRF is an important OCT feature adding to the  understanding of disease progression. Hyperreflective foci presence was  associated with delays in DA, indicating HRF is a marker for visual cycle  impairment.

abstract="PURPOSE: This study investigates deep-learning (DL) sequence modeling techniques  to reliably fit dark adaptation (DA) curves and estimate their key parameters in  patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to improve robustness and  curve predictions. METHODS: A long-short-term memory autoencoder was used as the  DL method to model the DA curve. The performance was compared against the  classical nonlinear regression method using goodness-of-fit and repeatability  metrics. Experiments were performed to predict the latter portion of the curve  using data from early measurements. The prediction accuracy was quantified as the  rod intercept time (RIT) prediction error between predicted and actual curves.  RESULTS: The two models had comparable goodness-of-fit measures, with root mean  squared error (RMSE; SD) = 0.11 (0.04) log-units (LU) for the classical model and  RMSE = 0.13 (0.06) LU for the DL model. Repeatability of the curve fits evaluated  after introduction of random perturbations, and after performing repeated  testing, demonstrated superiority of the DL method, especially among parameters  related to cone decay. The DL method exhibited superior ability to predict the  curve and RIT using points prior to -2 LU, with 3.1 {\textpm} 3.1 minutes RIT prediction  error, compared to 19.1 {\textpm} 18.6 minutes RIT error for the classical method.  CONCLUSIONS: The parameters obtained from the DL method demonstrated superior  robustness as well as predictability of the curve. These could provide important  advances in using multiple DA curve parameters to characterize AMD severity.  TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Dark adaptation is an important functional measure in  studies of AMD and curve modeling using DL methods can lead to improved clinical  trial end points.",

abstract="Preservation of photoreceptors beyond areas of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy  is a critical treatment goal in eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) to prevent  vision loss. Thus, we assessed the association of treatment with the complement  C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan with optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based  photoreceptor laminae thicknesses in this post hoc analysis of the FILLY trial  (NCT02503332). Retinal layers in OCT were segmented using a deep-learning-based  pipeline and extracted along evenly spaced contour-lines surrounding areas of GA.  The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in (standardized) outer  nuclear layer (ONL) thickness at the 5.16{\textdegree}-contour-line at month 12. Participants  treated with pegcetacoplan monthly had a thicker ONL along the 5.16{\textdegree} contour-line  compared to the pooled sham arm (mean difference [95{\%} CI]{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}0.29 z-score units  [0.16, 0.42], P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). The same was evident for eyes treated with  pegcetacoplan every other month (+{\thinspace}0.26 z-score units [0.13, 0.4], P{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001).  Additionally, eyes treated with pegcetacoplan exhibited a thicker photoreceptor  inner segment layer along the 5.16{\textdegree}-contour-line at month 12. These findings  suggest that pegcetacoplan could slow GA progression and lead to reduced thinning  of photoreceptor layers beyond the GA boundary. Future trials in earlier disease  stages, i.e., intermediate AMD, aiming to slow photoreceptor degeneration warrant  consideration.",

To study the extent to which these layers are disrupted in affected males and  female carriers, we performed multimodal adaptive optics imaging to better  visualize the in vivo pathogenesis of choroideremia in the living human eye. We  demonstrate the presence of subclinical, widespread enlarged RPE cells present in  all subjects imaged. In the fovea, the last area to be affected in choroideremia,  we found greater disruption to the RPE than to either the photoreceptor or  choriocapillaris layers. The unexpected finding of patches of photoreceptors that  were fluorescently-labeled, but structurally and functionally normal, suggests  that the RPE blood barrier function may be altered in choroideremia. Finally, we  introduce a strategy for detecting enlarged cells using conventional ophthalmic  imaging instrumentation. These findings establish that there is subclinical  polymegathism of RPE cells in choroideremia.",

Within the European multicenter,  cross-sectional MACUSTAR study, we have devised an automatic approach to  determine the mean rEZR [arbitrary units, AU] at two independent visits in SD-OCT  volume scans in study participants. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to  analyze the association of AMD stage and AMD associated high-risk features  including presence of pigmentary abnormalities, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD),  volume of the retinal-pigment-epithelial-drusenoid-complex (RPEDC) with the rEZR.  Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were determined for rEZR reliability  analysis.

abstract="PURPOSE: Tamoxifen-induced retinopathy (TR) and macular telangiectasia type 2  (MacTel) share a highly similar retinal phenotype. In this study, we aimed to  evaluate differences and similarities that may point toward underlying mechanisms  linking both disease entities. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross sectional study.  SUBJECTS: Patients diagnosed with MacTel or TR. METHODS: Patients underwent  multimodal retinal imaging, including color fundus photography, spectral-domain  OCT, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and OCT angiography (if  available). Age, age of onset, best-corrected visual acuity, and bilaterality of  changes were evaluated. Patients' eyes were graded for different morphologic  characteristics by 4 experienced graders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phenotypical  characterization and comparison of frequencies of retinal characteristics of TR  and MacTel on multimodal imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients with  TR and 118 eyes of 59 patients with MacTel were included. Age, age of onset, and  best-corrected visual acuity were similar in both cohorts. All but 1 patient  showed bilateral changes. In patients with MacTel, neurodegenerative changes and  vascular alterations were equally present, whereas in patients with TR,  neurodegenerative changes usually prevailed. Predilection sites within the  central retina differed between the 2 diseases: most findings in patients with TR  were limited to the foveal center, whereas changes in patients with MacTel were  present throughout a slightly larger region (``MacTel area''), with an epicenter  temporal to the foveal center. Distinct morphologic features included the  distribution of retinal crystals, the size and position of ellipsoid zone breaks,  and the presence of hyperreflective changes on OCT images. Focal  hyperpigmentation and neovascular membranes were only present in eyes with  MacTel. CONCLUSIONS: Macular telangiectasia and TR share a highly similar retinal  phenotype, especially in early disease stages. Subtle differences on multimodal  retinal images may help distinguish between these 2 disease entities. Our  findings indicate the involvement of M{\"u}ller cells in both diseases, which may  explain the observed phenotypic characteristics and similarities.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate scotopic contour  deformation detection (sCDD), and its structural determinants, in participants  with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) with or without  reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). METHODS: Forty-one participants (aged 58-89 years),  including 9 with iAMD and RPD, 16 with iAMD only, and 16 controls, underwent  functional testing. The sCDD was evaluated with radial frequency arcs presented  at 4 loci: {\textpm}4 degrees and 8 degrees vertical eccentricity. Scotopic thresholds  and dark adaptation (DA) were measured at the same loci. Retinal layers of  spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans were  segmented. To establish the concurrent validity of the functional test, we  evaluated the fraction of variability in sCDD thresholds explained by SD-OCT  data. RESULTS: The iAMD group had significantly worse sCDD thresholds compared  with controls (8 degrees inferior retina: P = 0.004 and the 4 degrees loci: P <  0.02 for both). Elevated sCDD thresholds were observed in iAMD and RPD eyes at  loci with normal scotopic thresholds; the opposite was rarely encountered.  Elevated sCDD thresholds were also observed in iAMD eyes with normal DA. Elevated  sCDD thresholds were associated with increased age and presence of late AMD in  the fellow eye. The optimal machine learning model predicted 16{\%} of variability  (cross-validated R2) in sCDD thresholds at 8 degrees. DISCUSSION: A novel  scotopic contour deformation task can provide unique information about rod  dysfunction in participants with iAMD and RPD not observed with structural and  other functional assessments. Rod dysfunction observed with scotopic contour  deformation testing was associated with factors linked to risk of AMD  progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: Relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity (rEZR) has been reported to be  reduced in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). However,  longitudinal changes in rEZR remain unknown. This study investigated the natural  history of rEZR in iAMD and its association with risk factors for disease  progression, including the presence or extent of drusen volume, reticular  pseudodrusen (RPD), and pigmentary abnormalities (PAs). DESIGN: Longitudinal  observational study. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects with bilateral large drusen. METHODS:  Spectral-domain (SD) OCT images of both eyes from each participant were obtained  every 6 months for 3 years. Using an automated rEZR determination approach, the  average rEZR of the central 20{\textdegree} macula was determined for each SD-OCT volume  scan. Linear mixed models were used to determine the rate of change in rEZR with  age (using the cross-sectional data at baseline) and over time (longitudinal  data) and the interactions between the rate of rEZR changes with AMD risk factors  at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity and its  rate of change with age and over time. RESULTS: A total of 280 eyes from 140  individuals with bilateral large drusen were included in this study.  Cross-sectional data showed that rEZR reduced with increasing age (-8.4 arbitrary  units [AUs] per decade; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], -11.5 to -5.2; P < 0.001).  Longitudinal data showed that, on average, rEZR declined at a rate of -2.1 AU per  year (95{\%} CI, -2.6 to -1.6 AU per year; P < 0.001). Larger RPD area (P = 0.042)  at baseline was associated with a faster rate of rEZR decline over time, whereas  the presence of PAs and the drusen volume at baseline showed no significant  association with rEZR decline over time (P = 0.068 and P = 0.529, respectively).  CONCLUSIONS: The rEZR significantly reduces over 3 years in subjects with iAMD,  and both the presence and increasing extent of coexistent RPD at baseline are  associated with a faster rate of decline. These findings warrant further studies  to understand the value of rEZR as a biomarker of AMD progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the suitability of 6 rod- or cone-mediated dark  adaptation (DA) parameters as outcome measures for clinical trials in age-related  macular degeneration (AMD), including their retest reliability, association with  age and disease severity, and measurable longitudinal change over time. DESIGN:  Prospective, longitudinal study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01352975). PARTICIPANTS:  A total of 191 patients with AMD and older participants followed longitudinally  over 5 years. METHODS: Dark adaptation testing was performed using the AdaptDx  dark adaptometer with a maximum test time of 40 minutes. A 2-part  exponential-linear curve was fitted to obtain values for cone decay, cone  plateau, time to rod-cone break, rod intercept time (RIT), rod adaptation rate  (S2), and area under the curve. Intersession retest reliability was assessed in  tests performed within 2 weeks using the Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship  of DA parameters with age, AMD severity, and reticular pseudodrusen (RPD)  presence was evaluated using linear mixed models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retest  reliability, association with disease severity, and longitudinal change of 6 DA  parameters. RESULTS: A total of 1329 DA curves were analyzed. Rod intercept time  was the parameter that showed the greatest reliability (intraclass correlation  coefficient of 0.88) and greatest association with age, AMD severity, and RPD  (marginal R(2) of 0.38), followed by the rod-mediated parameters area under the  curve and rod-cone break. Cone plateau appeared constant at lower RIT values but  increased with progressive rod dysfunction (RIT > 22.8 minutes) with a slope of  0.07 log units per 10 minutes RIT prolongation. Therefore, it might provide  additional information in the advanced stages of AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related  macular degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with large  differences in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition, substantial differences  in some parameters occur with age, even accounting for AMD severity and RPD  status. This supports the 2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and  perhaps AMD pathophysiology itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the highest  retest reliability, closest correlation with AMD severity and RPD, and largest  longitudinal changes. This underscores the suitability of RIT as an outcome  measure in clinical trials. The cone plateau increases only in advanced stages of  kinetic rod dysfunction, indicating rod dysfunction preceding cone dysfunction  and degeneration in the temporal sequence of pathology in AMD.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) occur in association with  various chorioretinal diseases. With respect to the broad clinical spectrum of  PEDs we describe fundus autofluorescence (FAF) characteristics of PEDs. METHODS:  Ninety-three eyes of 66 patients (mean age 71.9{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}11.1) with uni- or bilateral  PED ({\thinspace}≥{\thinspace}350{\thinspace}{\textmu}m) were included in a retrospective cross-sectional study. PEDs were  secondary to age-related macular degeneration (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}79), central serous  chorioretinopathy (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}7), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2), pattern  dystrophy (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3) or idiopathic PED (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}2). FAF images were recorded using  confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (488{\thinspace}nm excitation wavelength, detection  of emission{\thinspace}>500{\thinspace}nm). Diagnosis of PED was confirmed using spectral-domain  optical coherence tomography. A qualitative FAF grading system was established,  and grading was performed by two independent readers. RESULTS: PEDs showed highly  variable characteristics on FAF imaging. FAF within the area of PED was found to  be irregular/granular (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}59, 63.4{\%}), increased (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}28, 30.1{\%}), decreased  (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3, 3.2 {\%}), or normal (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}3, 3.2{\%}). Accompanying FAF changes included  condensation of macular pigment (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}67, 72.0{\%}), focally increased FAF at the PED  apex (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}14, 15.1{\%}) or elsewhere (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}52, 55.9{\%}), focally decreased FAF (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}23,  24.7{\%}), a cartwheel-like pattern (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}10, 10.8{\%}), a doughnut sign (n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}6, 6.5{\%}),  and a halo of decreased FAF encircling the PED (completely n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}20, 21.5{\%} or  incompletely n{\thinspace}={\thinspace}20, 21.5{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: PEDs show a variety of abnormal  patterns on FAF imaging. These changes in FAF signals may be secondary to  morphological and metabolic alterations within corresponding retinal layers and  do not necessarily correspond with the underlying PED subtype or a specific  pathology.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze the intersession repeatability of structural biomarkers in  eyes with early and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) within  the cross-sectional part of the observational multicenter MACUSTAR study.  METHODS: Certified site personnel obtained multimodal imaging data at two visits  (38 {\textpm} 20 [mean {\textpm} standard deviation] days apart), including spectral-domain  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). One junior reader performed systematic and  blinded grading at the central reading center, followed by senior reader review.  Structural biomarkers included maximum drusen size classification (>63 to ≤125 {\textmu}m  vs. >125 {\textmu}m), presence of large pigment epithelium detachments (PEDs), reticular  pseudodrusen (RPD), vitelliform lesions, and refractile deposits. Intrasession  variability was assessed using Cohen's $\kappa$ statistics. RESULTS: At the first visit,  202 study eyes of 202 participants were graded as manifesting with either early  (n = 34) or intermediate (n = 168) AMD. Grading of imaging data between visits  revealed perfect agreement for the maximum drusen size classification ($\kappa$ = 0.817;  95{\%} confidence interval, 0.70-0.94). In iAMD eyes, perfect to substantial  agreement was determined for the presence of large PEDs (0.87; 0.69-1.00) and RPD  (0.752; 0.63-0.87), while intersession agreement was lower for the presence of  vitelliform lesions (0.649; 0.39-0.65) and refractile deposits (0.342;  -0.029-0.713), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal retinal imaging analysis  between sessions showed a higher repeatability for structural biomarkers with  predefined cutoff values than purely qualitative defined parameters.  TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: A high repeatability of retinal imaging biomarkers will  be important to implement automatic grading approaches and to establish robust  and meaningful structural clinical endpoints for future interventional clinical  trials in patients with iAMD.",

abstract="Dark adaptation (DA) refers to the slow recovery of visual sensitivity in  darkness following exposure to intense or prolonged illumination, which bleaches  a significant amount of the rhodopsin. This natural process also offers an  opportunity to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate for  presence of disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a key indicator of  retinal health, which can be altered in the presence of certain diseases, such as  age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of  DA measurement and its significance to furthering our understanding of AMD has  revealed essential findings underlying the pathobiology of the disease. The  process of dark adaptation involves phototransduction taking place mainly between  the photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer.  DA occurs over a large range of luminance and is modulated by both cone and rod  photoreceptors. In the photopic ranges, rods are saturated and cone cells adapt  to the high luminance levels. However, under scotopic ranges, cones are unable to  respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate the responses to lower levels of  light as they can respond to even a single photon. Since the cone visual cycle is  also based on the Muller cells, measuring the impairment in rod-based dark  adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases such as AMD, which  involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark adaptation parameters are metrics  derived from curve-fitting dark adaptation sensitivities over time and can  represent specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod break (CRB)  and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly sensitive to changes in the outer  retina. There is some structural and functional continuum between normal aging  and the AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod intercept  time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD patients with increasing  disease severity determined by increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the  presence of subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain  morphological features in the peripheral retina. Specifications of spatial  testing location, repeatability of the testing, ease and availability of the  testing device in clinical settings, and test duration in elderly population are  also important. We provide a detailed overview in light of all these factors.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that M{\"u}ller cell dysfunction in macular  telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) results in delayed cone adaptation kinetics and to  assess absolute cone and rod thresholds in this condition. METHODS: Adaptation  after an approximate 63.5{\%} full-field cone photopigment bleach was assessed for  Goldmann size V (1.7{\textdegree} diameter) 640 nm (red) and 480 nm (blue) targets presented  at a retinal locus corresponding to 2{\textdegree} temporal to fixation. The cone time  constant of adaptation and absolute cone and rod thresholds were calculated from  exponential functions fitted to the resultant dark adaptation curves. RESULTS:  Eighteen eyes with MacTel (from 11 patients) were compared with 19 control eyes  (from 16 normal subjects). Cone adaptation kinetics were significantly impaired  in MacTel, as was the absolute cone threshold. Final thresholds for blue targets  were also significantly elevated in MacTel, consistent with impaired rod absolute  threshold. Losses in sensitivity observed in MacTel were consistent with a  so-called d1/2 mechanism (i.e., receptoral) site of sensitivity loss. CONCLUSION:  In addition to previously documented impairments in rod dark adaptation, MacTel  results in a significant elevation in cone thresholds because of pathology at the  level of the photoreceptors. The delays in cone adaptation that we found in eyes  with MacTel may reflect impairment of the M{\"u}ller cell-mediated cone-specific  visual cycle.",

Longitudinal spectral-domain  optical coherence tomography volume scans (37 B-scans, 30{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 15{\textdegree}) were segmented  using a deep learning (DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype analysis, a model of  ABCA4 variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss (6.25 mm2) as the  dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an average (square-root-transformed)  EZ-loss progression rate of [95{\%} CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer  (ONL) thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average distance from the  EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL thickness (to {\textpm}2 z score units) was  3.20{\textdegree} [2.53, 3.87]. Inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thinning was less  pronounced, with an average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to layer thickness  normalization of 1.20{\textdegree} [0.91, 1.48] for the IS and 0.60{\textdegree} [0.49, 0.72] for the OS.

abstract="PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to quantify choriocapillaris (CC) flow  alterations in early Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) and to investigate the  relationship of the CC flow deficits with the choroidal and outer retinal  microstructure. METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, 18 eyes of 11  patients with early SFD and 31 eyes of 31 controls without ocular pathology  underwent multimodal imaging, including spectral-domain optical coherence  tomography (OCT), followed by deep-learning-based layer segmentation. OCT  angiography (OCTA) was performed to quantify CC flow signal deficits (FDs).  Differences in CC FD density between SFD patients and controls were determined,  and the relationships with choroidal thickness, retinal pigment epithelium-drusen  complex (RPEDC) thickness and outer retinal layer thicknesses were analyzed using  mixed-model analysis. RESULTS: SFD patients exhibited a significantly greater CC  FD density than controls (estimate [95{\%} CI]: +20.0{\%}FD [13.3; 26.7], p < 0.001 for  SFD patients), even when adjusted for age. Square-root transformed choroidal  thickness was a structural OCT surrogate of the CC FD density (-2.1{\%}FD per {\textsurd}{\textmu}m, p  < 0.001), whereas RPEDC thickness was not informative regarding CC FD (p =  0.061). The CC FD density was associated with an altered microstructure of the  overlying photoreceptors (outer segments, inner segments, and outer nuclear layer  thinning of -0.19 $\mu$m, -0.08 $\mu$m and -0.30 $\mu$m per {\%}FD, respectively, all p <  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early SFD exhibit pronounced abnormalities of  CC flow signal on OCTA, which are not limited to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen  on OCT imaging. Thus, analysis of the CC flow may enable clinical trials at  earlier disease stages in SFD.",

abstract="BACKGROUND/AIMS: To determine the association of age, presence of optic nerve  head drusen (ONHD) and number of previous intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial  growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections with inner retinal layer thicknesses in  patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). METHODS: In this retrospective  case-control study, longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography  imaging data from patients with PXE were compared with controls. A custom  deep-learning-based segmentation algorithm was trained and validated to quantify  the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). The  association of age, number of anti-VEGF injections and ONHD with the RNFL and GCL  thickness in the outer ETDRS subfields as dependent variables was investigated  using mixed model regression. RESULTS: Fourty-eight eyes of 30 patients with PXE  were compared with 100 healthy eyes. The mean age was 52.5{\textpm}12.9 years (range  21.3-68.2) for patients and 54.2{\textpm}18.7 years (range 18.0-84.5) for controls. In  patients, ONHD were visible in 15 eyes from 13 patients and 31 eyes had received  anti-VEGF injections. In the multivariable analysis, age (-0.10{\thinspace}{\textmu}m/year,  p<0.001), the diagnosis of PXE (-2.03{\thinspace}{\textmu}m, p=0.005) and an interaction term  between age and the presence of ONHD (-0.20{\thinspace}{\textmu}m/year, p=0.001) were significantly  associated with the GCL thickness. Including the number of intravitreal  injections did not improve the model fit. The RNFL thickness was not  significantly associated with any of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study  demonstrates a significant association of ageing and ONHD with GCL thinning in  patients with PXE, but not with the number of anti-VEGF injections. Given the  severity of inner retinal degeneration in PXE, a clinical trial investigating  neuroprotective therapy warrants consideration.",

abstract="Refined understanding of the association of retinal microstructure with current  and future (post-treatment) function in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy  (cCSC) may help to identify patients that would benefit most from treatment. In  this post-hoc analysis of data from the prospective, randomized PLACE trial  (NCT01797861), we aimed to determine the accuracy of AI-based inference of  retinal function from retinal morphology in cCSC. Longitudinal spectral-domain  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data from 57 eyes of 57 patients from  baseline, week 6-8 and month 7-8 post-treatment were segmented using  deep-learning software. Fundus-controlled perimetry data were aligned to the  SD-OCT data to extract layer thickness and reflectivity values for each test  point. Point-wise retinal sensitivity could be inferred with a (leave-one-out)  cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) [95{\%} CI] of 2.93 dB [2.40-3.46]  (scenario 1) using random forest regression. With addition of patient-specific  baseline data (scenario 2), retinal sensitivity at remaining follow-up visits was  estimated even more accurately with a MAE of 1.07 dB [1.06-1.08]. In scenario 3,  month 7-8 post-treatment retinal sensitivity was predicted from baseline SD-OCT  data with a MAE of 3.38 dB [2.82-3.94]. Our study shows that localized retinal  sensitivity can be inferred from retinal structure in cCSC using  machine-learning. Especially, prediction of month 7-8 post-treatment sensitivity  with consideration of the treatment as explanatory variable constitutes an  important step toward personalized treatment decisions in cCSC.",

abstract="IMPORTANCE: As a disabling and frequent disease, geographic atrophy secondary to  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) constitutes an important study subject.  Emerging clinical trials require suitable end points. The characterization and  validation of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is warranted.  OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate reading performance in geographic atrophy  and to assess its association with established visual function assessments and  structural biomarkers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The noninterventional,  prospective natural history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study  included patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at  the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled from June  2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and ended January 2021. MAIN  OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reading acuity and reading speed were assessed using  Radner charts. Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance  images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy, followed by  extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear mixed-effects models were  applied to investigate the association of those variables with reading  performance. RESULTS: A total of 150 eyes of 85 participants were included in  this study (median [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60{\%}]; 34 men  [40{\%}]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR) monocular reading  acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the reading acuity determination and a  reading speed of 52.8 (0-123) words per minute. In the multivariable  cross-sectional analysis, best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic  atrophy in the central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)  subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving geographic atrophy, and  area of geographic atrophy in the inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest  associations with reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.69).  Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were best-corrected visual  acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central  ETDRS subfield, in the inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS  subfield (R2 for reading speed{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.67). In the longitudinal analysis, a similar  prediction accuracy for reading performance was determined (R2 for reading  acuity{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.73; R2 for reading speed{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve  when follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular reading  performance did not differ from reading performance in the better-seeing eye.  CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The association of reading acuity and speed with  visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading  performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These findings suggest  that measures in clinical and low-vision care for patients with geographic  atrophy should focus primarily on the better-seeing eye.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: To model the progression of geographic atrophy (GA) in patients with  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by building a suitable statistical  regression model for GA size measurements obtained from fundus autofluorescence  imaging. METHODS: Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a linear  mixed-effects model for GA size progression that incorporates  covariable-dependent enlargement rates as well as correlations between  longitudinally collected GA size measurements. To capture nonlinear progression  in a flexible way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with  different transformation parameters $\lambda$. Model evaluation is performed on data  collected for two longitudinal, prospective multi-center cohort studies on GA  size progression. RESULTS: A transformation parameter of $\lambda$=0.45 yielded the best  model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When hypertension and  hypercholesterolemia were included as risk factors in the model, they showed an  association with progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this  model was 67.21{\textpm}6.49 years. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive framework for  modeling the course of uni- or bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal  observational studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset  estimation, identification of risk factors and prediction of future GA size. A  square-root transformation of atrophy size is recommended before model fitting.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To elucidate morphological determinants of rod and cone dysfunction in  Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD), and to systematically compare visual function  tests for interventional trials. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study.  METHODS: Patients with SFD (n = 16) and controls (n = 20) underwent visual  function testing (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and low luminance visual  acuity [LLVA], contrast sensitivity, mesopic and dark-adapted (DA)  fundus-controlled perimetry [FCP], rod-mediated dark adaptation [RMDA]), and  multimodal imaging. Vision-related quality of life was evaluated. FCP and RMDA  thresholds were analyzed using mixed models and structure-function correlation  using machine learning (ML). Longitudinal data of 1 patient with high-dose  vitamin A supplementation were available. RESULTS: Although photopic BCVA was  normative in SFD, LLVA was impaired (0.30 LogMAR [0.20; 0.45] vs 0.20 LogMAR  [0.03; 0.28], P < .05). Scotopic visual function exhibited a delayed  rod-intercept time (21 minutes [12.15; 21] vs 4.05 minutes [3.22; 5.36], P <  .001), and marked DA cyan mean sensitivity loss (-11.80 dB [-3.47; -19.85]),  paralleled by a reduced vision-related quality of life. ML-based  structure-function correlation allowed prediction of mesopic, DA cyan, and red  sensitivity with high accuracy (cross-validated mean absolute error: 4.36, 7.77,  and 5.31 dB, respectively), whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the absence of  fundus alterations on multimodal imaging. After high-dose vitamin A  supplementation, RMDA and DA thresholds improved markedly. CONCLUSIONS: Patients  with SFD exhibit severely impaired scotopic visual function even in the absence  of funduscopic alterations on multimodal imaging. In contrast to BCVA, scotopic  visual function tests are suitable to quantify dysfunction in the early stages.  Improvement of scotopic dysfunction after (off-label) high-dose vitamin A intake,  as observed in one patient in our study, is compatible with the hypothesized  local deficiency of vitamin A secondary to Bruch's membrane alterations.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate multimodal retinal imaging characteristics including the  retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with RPGR-associated  retinitis pigmentosa (RP). METHODS: This cross-sectional case-control study  included 17 consecutive patients (median age, 21 years) with RPGR-associated RP  who underwent retinal imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT),  short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (AF) imaging, and RNFL scans centered on  the optic disc. RNFL thickness was manually segmented and compared to clinical  and imaging parameters including the transfoveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) width, the  horizontal diameter of the macular hyperautofluorescent ring. RNFL thickness was  compared to 17 age- and sex-matched controls. RESULTS: In patients with  RPGR-associated RP, the EZ width (R(2){\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.65), the central hyperautofluorescent  ring on AF images (R(2){\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.72), and visual acuity (R(2){\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.68) were negatively  correlated with age. In comparison to controls, a significantly (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.0001)  increased global RNFL thickness was identified in RPGR-associated RP, which was,  however, less pronounced in progressed disease as indicated by the EZ width or  the diameter of the central hyperautofluorescent ring. CONCLUSIONS: This study  describes retinal characteristics in patients with RPGR-associated RP including a  pronounced peripapillary RNFL thickness compared to healthy controls. These  results contribute to the knowledge about imaging biomarkers in RP, which might  be of interest for therapeutic approaches such as gene replacement therapies.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To probabilistically forecast needed anti-vascular endothelial growth  factor (anti-VEGF) treatment frequency using volumetric spectral domain-optical  coherence tomography (SD-OCT) biomarkers in neovascular age-related macular  degeneration from real-world settings. METHODS: SD-OCT volume scans were  segmented with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal thickness  and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early  Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers  (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS],  retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid).  Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency  within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural  gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The  mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment  frequency was the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: In a total of 138 visits of  99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the  prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy  (MAE [95{\%} confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390)  using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094)  using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and  reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation  of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important  predictor across models. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed, fully automated pipeline  enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in  real-world settings. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Prediction of a probability  distribution allows the physician to inspect the underlying uncertainty.  Predictive uncertainty estimates are essential to highlight cases where  human-inspection and/or reversion to a fallback alternative is warranted.",

METHODS: In this retrospective study, eyes with  a minimum observation period of 6 months prior to the de novo diagnosis of an  exudative neovascularisation secondary to MacTel were analysed. Morphological  changes preceding the formation of neovascularisation were evaluated using colour  fundus photography, infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular pigment  measurement and optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT-angiography (OCT-A)  images were additionally available in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eyes  from 20 patients were examined over a median period of 17 months (range: 6-100  months). Eyes were characterised by an accelerated progression of ellipsoid zone  loss (median of 0.013{\thinspace}mm(2)/month), increased thickness of the temporal parafovea  and hyper-reflective lesions on OCT. The latter underwent morphological changes  preceding the development of exudative neovascularisation, including an increase  in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal layers and the retinal  pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a foveal depletion of macular pigment. On  OCT-A, a focal increase in blood flow was observed at the level of the outer  retina/choriocapillaris, and retinal-retinal and retinal-choroidal anastomoses  preceded the formation of exudative neovascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal  imaging allows the identification of prognostic morphological features preceding  the formation of exudative neovascularisation in MacTel. Eyes exhibiting these  characteristics should be monitored closely and patients should be alert for  emergent symptoms in order to detect and treat neovascularisation early and,  thereby, prevent irreversible visual loss.",

abstract="Sensitive and robust outcome measures of retinal function are pivotal for  clinical trials in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A recent development  is the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer results of  psychophysical examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging. We  conducted a review of the current literature referenced in PubMed and Web of  Science among others with the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'machine  learning' in combination with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)',  'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So far AI-based  structure-function correlations have been applied to infer conventional visual  field, fundus-controlled perimetry, and electroretinography data, as well as  BCVA, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD, inference  of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate BCVA results with a root  mean squared error of {\~}7-11 letters, which is comparable to the accuracy of  actual visual acuity assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation  can successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results both for mesopic  as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red testing (hereafter termed inferred  sensitivity). Accuracy of inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short  FCP examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of {\~}3-5 dB for mesopic, DA  cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred retinal sensitivity, based  on multimodal imaging, may be considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint  for future interventional clinical trials in the future.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the interreader agreement for incomplete retinal pigment  epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA) and complete RPE and outer  retinal atrophy (cRORA) and their related features in age-related macular  degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Interreader agreement study. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve  readers from 6 reading centers. METHODS: After formal training, readers  qualitatively assessed 60 OCT B-scans from 60 eyes with AMD for 9 individual  features associated with early atrophy and performed 7 different annotations to  quantify the spatial extent of OCT features within regions of interest. The  qualitative and quantitative features were used to derive the presence of iRORA  and cRORA and also in an exploratory analysis to examine if agreement could be  improved using different combinations of features to define OCT atrophy. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURES: Interreader agreement based on Gwet's first-order agreement  coefficient (AC(1)) for qualitatively graded OCT features and classification of  iRORA and cRORA, and smallest real difference (SRD) for quantitatively graded OCT  features. RESULTS: Substantial or better interreader agreement was observed for  all qualitatively graded OCT features associated with atrophy (AC(1) =  0.63-0.87), except for RPE attenuation (AC(1) = 0.46) and disruption (AC(1) =  0.26).

Moderate  agreement was found for a 3-category classification of no atrophy, iRORA, and  cRORA (AC(1) = 0.53). Exploratory analyses suggested a significantly higher level  of agreement for a 3-category classification using (1) no atrophy; (2) presence  of inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer subsidence, or a hyporeflective  wedge-shaped band, as a less severe atrophic grade; and (3) the latter plus an  additional requirement of choroidal hypertransmission of 250 $\mu$m or more for a  more severe atrophic grade (AC(1) = 0.68; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of  iRORA and cRORA, and most of their associated features, can be performed  relatively consistently and robustly. A refined combination of features to define  early atrophy could further improve interreader agreement.",

abstract="Spatially-resolved retinal function can be measured by psychophysical testing  like fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP or 'microperimetry'). It may serve as a  performance outcome measure in emerging interventional clinical trials for  macular diseases as requested by regulatory agencies. As FCP constitute laborious  examinations, we have evaluated a machine-learning-based approach to predict  spatially-resolved retinal function ('inferred sensitivity') based on  microstructural imaging (obtained by spectral domain optical coherence  tomography) and patient data in recessive Stargardt disease. Using nested  cross-validation, prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95{\%} CI])  4.74 dB [4.48-4.99] were achieved. After additional inclusion of limited FCP  data, the latter reached 3.89 dB [3.67-4.10] comparable to the test-retest MAE  estimate of 3.51 dB [3.11-3.91]. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed,  that the IS{\&}OS and RPE thickness were the most important features for the  prediction of retinal sensitivity. 'Inferred sensitivity', herein, enables to  accurately estimate differential effects of retinal microstructure on  spatially-resolved function in Stargardt disease, and might be used as  quasi-functional surrogate marker for a refined and time-efficient investigation  of possible functionally relevant treatment effects or disease progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To define, characterize, and classify hyperreflectivity on optical  coherence tomography and report its prevalence in macular telangiectasia Type 2.  METHODS: In a primary cross-sectional analysis, multimodal imaging data were  retrospectively analyzed. The definition of hyperreflectivity and  neovascularization on optical coherence tomography followed optical coherence  tomography angiography-based criteria. Eyes were graded for the presence of  hyperreflectivity and neovascularization and further categorized into three  classes based on position and extent of hyperreflectivity. In a secondary  analysis, eyes were reviewed for ≥24 months using optical coherence tomography  imaging. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-two eyes from 161 patients were  analyzed in the cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177  (55{\%}) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15{\%}) eyes. Hyperreflectivity correlated  significantly with parameters indicative of disease progression. In the  longitudinal analysis, 206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of  35.6 months. 17/86 eyes (20{\%}) showed a de novo development of hyperreflectivity.  8/29 eyes (28{\%}) with preexistent intraretinal hyperreflectivity developed outer  retinal hyperreflectivity. A high proportion of eyes with outer retinal  hyperreflectivity (17/52 [33{\%}]) developed neovascular membranes. CONCLUSION:  Hyperreflectivity represents a common finding in macular telangiectasia Type 2  but lacks a uniform definition. We propose a hyperreflectivity grading scale that  may help to estimate disease progression and identify eyes at risk for developing  neovascular membranes.",

abstract="INTRODUCTION: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic correlation of clinical  data with data obtained from postmortem tissue donation is of great benefit. In  this respect, the establishment of an eye donation registry represents a  prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. METHODS: A total of 300 patients  were interviewed at a tertiary referral center in Germany by means of a  standardized questionnaire. Binary questions were evaluated by percentage;  Likert-scaled questions (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the  median and 25th (Q25) and 75th (Q75) percentiles. RESULTS: The majority of  patients (77.0{\%}) would agree to donate their eyes for research purposes. When  asked about reasons against an eye donation, 60.9{\%} of all patients only stated  reasons in the category ``addressable'' (e.g., not enough awareness of the topic).  The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate for an ophthalmologist to  approach them on the issue of postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1).  CONCLUSION: Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye  donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given against postmortem eye  donation were often related to misconceptions and were potentially addressable.  These results underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological patients  in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research purposes.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic, functional, genetic,  and imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium atrophy progression  secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy. METHODS: Patients with retinal pigment  epithelium atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy were examined  longitudinally with fundus autofluorescence imaging. Lesion area, perimeter,  circularity, caliper diameters, and focality of areas with definitely decreased  autofluorescence were determined. A model was used to predict the lesion  enlargement rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were  performed to model the power in a simulated interventional study. RESULTS:  Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range, 14-78 years) with a follow-up time of  10 to 100 months were included. The mean annual progression of retinal pigment  epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic areas, the retina-wide  functional impairment, and the age-of-onset category constituted significant  predictors for future retinal pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining 25.7{\%}  of the variability. By extension of a simulated study length and/or specific  patient preselection based on these baseline characteristics, the required sample  size could significantly be reduced. CONCLUSION: Trial design based on specific  shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics and the adaption  of the trial duration may provide potential benefits in required cohort size and  absolute number of visits.",

Because manual quantification of rEZR is laborious and lacks of spatial  resolution, automated quantification of the rEZR would be beneficial. The purpose  of this study was to evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of an automated  rEZR quantification method. METHODS: The rEZR was acquired using a manual and an  automated approach in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and  healthy controls. The rEZR obtained from both methods was compared and the  agreement between the methods and their reproducibility assessed. RESULTS: Forty  eyes of 40 participants with a mean ({\textpm} standard deviation) age of 65.2 {\textpm} 7.8  years were included. Both the manual and automated method showed that control  eyes exhibit a greater rEZR than AMD eyes (P < 0.001). Overall, the limits of  agreement between the manual and automated method were -7.5 to 7.3 arbitrary  units (AU) and 95{\%} of the data points had a difference in the rEZR between the  methods of {\textpm}8.2{\%}. An expected perfect reproducibility was observed for the  automated method, whereas the manual method had a coefficient of repeatability of  6.3 arbitrary units. CONCLUSIONS: The automated quantification of rEZR method is  reliable and reproducible. Further studies of the rEZR as a novel biomarker for  AMD severity and progression are warranted. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Automated  quantification of SD-OCT-based rEZR allows for its comprehensive and longitudinal  characterization evaluating its relevance as an in vivo biomarker of  photoreceptor function and its prognostic value for AMD progression.",

abstract="IMPORTANCE: Correlates for Bruch membrane alterations are needed for  interventional trials targeting the Bruch membrane in pseudoxanthoma elasticum  (PXE). OBJECTIVES: To quantify mesopic and scotopic light sensitivity and  identify its microstructural correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane  in patients with PXE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A prospective,  single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted at a tertiary  referral center from January 31, 2018, to February 20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of  22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals were included. Data  analysis was completed March 15, 2020. EXPOSURES: Mesopic and dark-adapted  2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal retinal  imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT  angiography were performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed  models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was performed using  machine learning. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Observed dark-adapted cyan  sensitivity loss as measure of rod photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean  absolute error between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the  accuracy of structure-function correlation. RESULTS: Of the 22 patients with PXE  included in this study, 15 were women (68{\%}); median age was 56.5 years  (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2). These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate,  5.13 dB; 95{\%} CI, 2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95{\%} CI,  6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95{\%} CI, 4.83-9.27 dB)  sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was also evident in 9 eyes with  nonneovascular PXE (mesopic: estimate, 3.21 dB; 95{\%} CI, 1.28-5.14 dB;  dark-adapted cyan: 5.93 dB; 95{\%} CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing:  4.84 dB; 95{\%} CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal pattern of  sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the periphery. Retinal function  could be predicted from microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors,  of 4.91 dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for  dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis highlighted an association  of a thinned inner retina and putative separation of the  pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor complex with sensitivity loss. CONCLUSIONS AND  RELEVANCE: In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without  choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being  most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that  pathologic characteristics of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod  photoreceptor degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative  pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair rod function,  while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with overall  dysfunction.",

abstract="PURPOSE: Two-colour computerised perimetry is a technique developed for assessing  cone- and rod-function at fixed background luminances in retinal disease.  However, the state of adaptation during testing is unknown but crucial in the  interpretation of results. We therefore aimed to determine the adaptational state  of rod- and cone-mechanisms in two-colour perimetry. METHODS: Sensitivity to  480 nm (blue) and 640 nm (red) Goldmann size V targets was determined for 10  normal subjects aged 16 to 46 years at 17 locations in the central 60 degrees of  the visual field under scotopic conditions and then from -1.5 log cd m(-2) to 2  log cd m(-2) (white background) in 0.5 log unit steps. Data were fitted with  threshold versus intensity (tvi) functions of the form logT = logT(0) + log  ((A + A(0) )/A(0) )(n) . RESULTS: No clear rod-cone break was observed for 640 nm  stimuli. For 480 nm stimuli, transition from rod-detection to cone-detection  occurred at mesopic illumination levels, where rod adaptation approached Weber  behaviour. Cone detection mechanisms did not display Weber-like adaptation until  the background luminance approached 1 log cd.m(-2) . Diseases resulting in a  ``filter effect'' - including disorders of the photoreceptors - are therefore  predicted to affect sensitivity when rod function is probed with short-wavelength  targets under scotopic conditions, but less so under mesopic conditions. Filter  effects are similarly anticipated to affect cone function measured using  long-wavelength targets under mesopic conditions (e.g., during microperimetry),  but less so under photopic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Asymmetries in adaptation in  automated two-colour perimetry are predicted to artefactually favour the  detection of losses in rod sensitivity under scotopic conditions and cones under  mesopic conditions.",

abstract="Fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called 'microperimetry') allows for  spatially-resolved mapping of visual sensitivity and measurement of fixation  stability, both in clinical practice as well as research. The accurate spatial  characterization of visual function enabled by FCP can provide insightful  information about disease severity and progression not reflected by  best-corrected visual acuity in a large range of disorders. This is especially  important for monitoring of retinal diseases that initially spare the central  retina in earlier disease stages. Improved intra- and inter-session  retest-variability through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up  examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent key advantages of  these technique. The design of disease-specific test patterns and protocols  reduces the burden of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more  meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also allow for  photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation of dark-adapted chromatic  and photopic testing. A detailed understanding of the variety of available  devices and test settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization  of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical trials.  Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and technical background of  FCP, its prior application in clinical and research settings, data that qualify  the application of FCP as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as  ongoing and future developments.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: Empirical models have been an integral part of everyday clinical  practice in ophthalmology since the introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff  (SRK) formula. Recent developments in the field of statistical learning  (artificial intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide range of  ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented precision. OBJECTIVE: Which  criteria must be considered for the evaluation of AI-related studies in  ophthalmology? MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exemplary prediction of visual acuity  (continuous outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes (discrete  outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical coherence tomography data  (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed  with nested cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and hyperparameter  optimization). RESULTS: Based on nested cross-validation for training, visual  acuity could be predicted in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute  error (MAE, 95{\%} confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]). Healthy  versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test data-set with an agreement  of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable  selection resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR [0.150;  0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting became obvious on  comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]).  CONCLUSION: Selection of an unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate  validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can obscure the actual  goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated pitfalls can help clinicians to  identify such shortcomings.",

OCTA en face 3 {\texttimes}  3-mm images of the superficial and deep retinal layers and the choriocapillaris  were acquired. Outcome parameters included vessel density (VD) and vessel  skeleton density (VSD) of the superficial and deep retinal layers, as well as  flow voids of the choriocapillaris. RESULTS: Twenty-eight eyes of 17 patients and  31 age-matched control eyes of 18 healthy subjects were included. VD and VSD of  the deep retinal layer were significantly reduced in hypertensive crisis (P ≤  0.004). Choriocapillaris signal intensity was more heterogeneous in patients, and  flow voids exhibited confluence with a larger average area and a lower absolute  count (P ≤ 0.045). These changes were independent of time since onset of  hypertensive crisis and of the presence and extent of retinopathy. Deep retinal  changes were associated with renal end-organ failure (P = 0.045). CONCLUSIONS:  Hypertensive crisis is associated with a significant reduction in retinal and  choroidal capillary perfusion based on OCTA findings. These alterations are  independent of retinopathy and related to end-organ damage. TRANSLATIONAL  RELEVANCE: OCTA might help distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive  emergency earlier than currently possible.",

abstract="IMPORTANCE: Sensitive outcome measures for disease progression are needed for  treatment trials in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular  degeneration (AMD). OBJECTIVE: To quantify photoreceptor degeneration outside  regions of GA in eyes with nonexudative AMD, to evaluate its association with  future GA progression, and to characterize its spatio-temporal progression.  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Monocenter cohort study (Directional Spread in  Geographic Atrophy [NCT02051998]) and analysis of data from a normative data  study at a tertiary referral center. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of 89 patients  with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years, median area of GA of 8.87 mm2 (IQR,  4.09-15.60), and median follow-up of 1.1 years (IQR, 0.52-1.7 years), as well as  93 normal eyes from 93 participants. EXPOSURES: Longitudinal spectral-domain  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (121 B-scans across 30{\textdegree}{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}25{\textdegree})  were segmented with a deep-learning pipeline and standardized in a pointwise  manner with age-adjusted normal data (z scores). Outer nuclear layer (ONL),  photoreceptor inner segment (IS), and outer segment (OS) thickness were  quantified along evenly spaced contour lines surrounding GA lesions. Linear mixed  models were applied to assess the association between photoreceptor-related  imaging features and GA progression rates and characterize the pattern of  photoreceptor degeneration over time. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Association of  ONL thinning with follow-up time (after adjusting for age, retinal topography [z  score], and distance to the GA boundary). RESULTS: The study included 158 eyes of  89 patients (51 women and 38 men) with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years. The  fully automated B-scan segmentation was accurate (dice coefficient, 0.82; 95{\%} CI,  0.80-0.85; compared with manual markings) and revealed a marked interpatient  variability in photoreceptor degeneration. The ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss-to-GA  boundary distance and OS thickness were prognostic for future progression rates.  Outer nuclear layer and IS thinning over time was significant even when adjusting  for age and proximity to the GA boundary (estimates of -0.16 $\mu$m/y; 95{\%} CI, -0.30  to -0.02; and -0.17 $\mu$m/y; 95{\%} CI, -0.26 to -0.09). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:  Distinct and progressive alterations of photoreceptor laminae (exceeding GA  spatially) were detectable and quantifiable. The degree of photoreceptor  degeneration outside of regions of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy varied  markedly between eyes and was associated with future GA progression. Macula-wide  photoreceptor laminae thinning represents a potential candidate end point to  monitor treatment effects beyond mere GA lesion size progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To examine longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and retinal  sensitivity in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD)  and predominantly reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). METHODS: At baseline 30 eyes of  25 iAMD patients underwent optical coherence tomography imaging, mesopic and  scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) with follow-up examinations at month  12 (20 eyes), 24 (12 eyes), and 36 (11 eyes). Thicknesses of different retinal  layers and results of FCP testing (n = 56 stimuli) were spatially and  longitudinally analyzed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At baseline,  the thickness of the partial outer retinal layer (pORL, 70.21 vs. 77.47 {\textmu}m) and  both mesopic (16.60 vs. 18.72 dB) and scotopic (12.14 vs. 18.67 dB) retinal  sensitivity were decreased in areas with RPD compared with unremarkable areas (P  < 0.001). Over three years, mean change of pORL was -0.66 normative standard  deviation (SD; i.e., z-score, P < 0.001) for regions with existing RPD, -0.40 SD  (P < 0.001) for regions with new occurring RPD, and -0.17 SD (P = 0.041) in  unremarkable regions. Decrease of scotopic and mesopic sensitivity over three  years was more pronounced in areas with existing (-3.51 and -7.76 dB) and new  occurring RPD (-2.06 and -5.97 dB). Structure-function analysis revealed that 1  SD decrease of pORL thickness was associated with a sensitivity reduction of 3.47  dB in scotopic and 0.79 dB in mesopic testing. CONCLUSIONS: This study  demonstrates progressive outer retinal degeneration and impairment of  photoreceptor function in eyes with iAMD and RPD over three years. Preservation  of outer retinal thickness and reduction of RPD formation may constitute  meaningful surrogate endpoints in interventional trials on eyes with AMD and RPD  aiming to slow outer retinal degeneration.",

abstract="Geographic atrophy (GA) represents the non-exudative late stage of age-related  macular degeneration and constitutes a leading cause of legal blindness in the  developed world. It is characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers  including photoreceptors, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and  rarefication of the choriocapillaris. As all three layers are functionally  connected, the precise temporal sequence and relative contribution of these  layers towards the development and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of  optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for  three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A, recent  studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly  associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and  are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be  helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential  protective effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the  context of GA has been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review  of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and  summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard to pathophysiologic  considerations, differential diagnosis, study design, and patient assessment.",

abstract="Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging is an in vivo imaging method that allows  for topographic mapping of naturally or pathologically occurring intrinsic  fluorophores of the ocular fundus. The dominant sources are fluorophores  accumulating as lipofuscin in lysosomal storage bodies in postmitotic retinal  pigment epithelium cells as well as other fluorophores that may occur with  disease in the outer retina and subretinal space. Photopigments of the  photoreceptor outer segments as well as macular pigment and melanin at the fovea  and parafovea may act as filters of the excitation light. FAF imaging has been  shown to be useful with regard to understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms,  diagnostics, phenotype-genotype correlation, identification of prognostic markers  for disease progression, and novel outcome parameters to assess efficacy of  interventional strategies in chorio-retinal diseases. More recently, the spectrum  of FAF imaging has been expanded with increasing use of green in addition to blue  FAF, introduction of spectrally-resolved FAF, near-infrared FAF, quantitative FAF  imaging and fluorescence life time imaging (FLIO). This article gives an overview  of basic principles, FAF findings in various retinal diseases and an update on  recent developments.",

abstract="Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)  measures have been shown to have prognostic value for recessive Stargardt disease  (also called ``ABCA4-related retinopathy''). These functional tests may serve as a  performance-outcome-measure (PerfO) in emerging interventional clinical trials,  but utility is limited by variability and patient burden. To address these  limitations, an ensemble machine-learning-based approach was evaluated to  differentiate patients from controls, and predict disease categories depending on  ERG ('inferred ERG') and visual impairment ('inferred visual impairment') as well  as BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') based on microstructural imaging (utilizing  spectral-domain optical coherence tomography) and patient data. The accuracy for  'inferred ERG' and 'inferred visual impairment' was up to 99.53 {\textpm} 1.02{\%}.  Prediction of BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') achieved a precision of {\textpm}0.3LogMAR in  up to 85.31{\%} of eyes. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed that foveal  status was the most important feature for BCVA prediction, while the thickness of  outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor inner and outer segments as well as age of  onset highly ranked for all predictions. 'Inferred ERG', 'inferred visual  impairment', and 'inferred BCVA', herein, represent accurate estimates of  differential functional effects of retinal microstructure, and offer  quasi-functional parameters with the potential for a refined patient assessment,  and investigation of potential future treatment effects or disease progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate differences in quantitative autofluorescence (qAF)  imaging measurements between eyes with and without large drusen, and whether qAF  measurements change over time in the eyes with large drusen. METHODS: Eighty-five  eyes from participants with bilateral large drusen and 51 eyes from healthy  participants underwent qAF imaging at least once, and the age-related macular  degeneration participants were reviewed 6-monthly. Normalized grey values at 9{\textdegree}  to 11{\textdegree} eccentricity from the fovea were averaged to provide a summary measure of  qAF values (termed qAF8). RESULTS: In a multivariable model, qAF8 measurements  were not significantly different between age-related macular degeneration eyes  with large drusen and healthy eyes (P = 0.130), and qAF8 measurements showed a  decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration eyes (P = 0.013).  CONCLUSION: These findings add to the body of evidence that qAF levels are not  increased in eyes with large drusen compared with healthy eyes, and qAF levels  show a significant decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration  eyes. These findings highlight how the relationship between qAF levels and  retinal pigment epithelium health does not seem to be straightforward. Further  investigation is required to better understand this relationship, especially if  qAF levels are to be used as an outcome measure in intervention trials.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the longitudinal association between outer retinal  microstructure and mesopic as well as scotopic retinal sensitivity in patients  with drusen secondary to intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD).  DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal natural history study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine  eyes of 54 patients with large drusen (> 125 $\mu$m) associated with iAMD and 27  age-matched healthy control eyes. METHODS: Participants underwent spectral-domain  OCT and both mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP). Annual  follow-up visits were performed over a 3-year period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:  Pointwise correlation of retinal sensitivity stimuli to corresponding  standardized (Z score) pointwise retinal thickness. Linear mixed-effect models  were applied to analyze longitudinally the association of pointwise retinal  thickness changes, follow-up time, or both with retinal function. RESULTS: At  baseline, mean pointwise sensitivity in patients was reduced by -1.67 dB (95{\%}  confidence interval [CI], -2.22 to -1.12) for mesopic and by -2.34 dB (95{\%} CI,  -2.85 to -1.84) for scotopic testing compared with controls with a pointwise  sensitivity change of -0.35 dB/year (95{\%} CI, -0.43 to -0.28) for mesopic  and +0.20 dB/year (95{\%} CI, 0.12-0.29) for scotopic testing, respectively (P <  0.001). Retinal thickness analysis in patients revealed a significantly thinner  outer nuclear layer (ONL) by -0.49 standard deviation (SD; 95{\%} CI, -0.70 to -0.28  SD) and a significant thicker retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC)  by +3.22 SD (95{\%} CI, 2.27-4.17 SD) at baseline, respectively (P < 0.001). During  follow-up, retinal thickness thickened further by +0.51 SD/year (RPEDC) and  thinned by -0.03 SD/year (ONL; P = 0.045) and -0.34 SD/year (inner and outer  photoreceptor segments) in patients, respectively (P < 0.001). Structure-function  analysis showed a significant association of the ONL and the RPEDC thickness  change with both types of FCP sensitivity testing (P < 0.001). Besides, follow-up  time had a significant (independent) effect on mesopic and scotopic retinal  sensitivity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal structure-function  correlation demonstrated a progressive quantifiable degeneration of the outer  retina in iAMD associated with photoreceptor dysfunction. Because longitudinal  sensitivity changes could not be explained by structural changes alone, an unmet  need remains for additional refined parameters on retinal structure to predict  retinal function.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of optical coherence tomography-angiography  (OCT-A) for monitoring activity, progression and response to therapy of  neovascularisations (NVs) secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel).  METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, eyes with NVs secondary to MacTel were  reviewed over a period of ≥8 months. Examinations at monthly intervals included  visual acuity testing, dilated funduscopy, spectral domain-OCT and OCT-A. Eyes  were treated with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth  factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and treatment decisions  were based on morphological signs of activity as determined by B-scan OCT and  funduscopy. Signs of neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal  thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and haemorrhages.  RESULTS: A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients were analysed. Patients were  evaluated over a mean period of 13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted  the monitoring of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth) of  NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular vessels was  detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity occurred on OCT. NVs showed a  progressive growth over time despite PRN-treatment and preferentially grew and  extended within areas characterised by a focal reduction of choriocapillaris  perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that OCT-A represents a useful  imaging modality for monitoring NV-progression and treatment effects in MacTel.  We demonstrate its advantages over conventional B-scan OCT imaging, including an  earlier detection of NV-progression, and propose an adjustment of the current  OCT-controlled PRN treatment regime in order to prevent NV-progression and  subsequent functional loss in neovascular MacTel.",

METHODS:  Patients with GA secondary to AMD were recruited in the context of the  prospective, non-interventional, natural-history Directional Spread in  Geographic-Atrophy study (NCT02051998). Fundus autofluorescence and infrared  reflectance images were semi-automatically annotated for GA. Linear mixed-effects  models were applied to investigate the association of putative determinants with  the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25) VRQoL.  RESULTS: A total of 87 patients with a mean age {\textpm} SD of 77.07 {\textpm} 7.49 years were  included in the analysis. At baseline, median (IQR) best-corrected visual acuity  (BCVA) was 0.3 (0.51) for the better eye and 0.89 (0.76) for the worse eye; 46{\%}  of the patients showed binocular and 25.3{\%} monocular non-central GA.

abstract="BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the applicability of mesopic light sensitivity  measurements obtained by fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also termed  'microperimetry') as clinical trial endpoint in Stargardt disease (STGD1).  METHODS: In this retrospective, monocentre cohort study, 271 eyes of 136 patients  (age, 37.1 years) with STGD1 and 87 eyes of 54 healthy controls (age, 41.0 years)  underwent mesopic FCP, using a pattern of 50 stimuli (achromatic, 400-800{\thinspace}nm)  centred on the fovea. The concurrent validity of mesopic FCP testing using the  MAIA device (CenterVue, Italy), the retest variability and its determinants, and  the progression of sensitivity loss over time were investigated using mixed-model  analyses. The main outcomes were the average pointwise sensitivity loss in  dependence of patients' demographic, functional and imaging characteristics, the  intrasession 95{\%} coefficient of repeatability, and the pointwise sensitivity loss  over time. RESULTS: Pointwise sensitivity loss was on average (estimate (95{\%}{\thinspace}CI))  13.88{\thinspace}dB (12.55 to 15.21) along the horizontal meridian and was significantly  associated with the electrophysiological subgroup, presence/absence of foveal  sparing, best-corrected visual acuity and disease duration. The 95{\%} coefficient  of repeatability was 12.15{\thinspace}dB (10.78 to 13.38) and varied in dependence of the  underlying mean sensitivity and local sensitivity slope. The global progression  rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45{\thinspace}dB/year (0.13 to 0.78) and was higher for  the central and inner ETDRS subfields compared with more peripheral regions.  CONCLUSIONS: Mesopic light sensitivity measured by FCP is reliable and  susceptible for functional changes. It constitutes a potential clinical outcome  for both natural history studies as well as future interventional studies in  patients with STGD1.",

abstract="The purpose of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of visual  function tests in intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). A total  of 62 subjects (38 patients with iAMD and 24 controls) were included and  underwent several functional assessments: Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA),  low luminance visual acuity (LLVA), visual acuity (VA) measured with the  Moorfields Vanishing Optotypes Acuity Charts (MAC), contrast sensitivity with the  Pelli-Robson test, reading speed using the International Reading Speed texts  (IReST) and mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry (S-MAIA, CenterVue, Padova,  Italy). Groups were compared using non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum tests and ROC  analyses. Linear regression was used to control for confounding. Results showed  that all visual function test performances except the IReST were significantly  reduced in iAMD patients compared to controls (p < 0.05). These effects did not  alter after controlling for age and sex. Best discrimination between iAMD and  controls yield the combination of LLVA and contrast sensitivity as well as MAC-VA  and contrast sensitivity (ROC area under the curve 0.95 and 0.93, respectively).  Our results suggest that LLVA, MAC-VA, contrast sensitivity and mesopic and  dark-adapted microperimetry can capture visual impairment characteristic for  iAMD. Best discrimination against iAMD is achieved with a combination of two  tests.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the association between retinal microstructure and cone  and rod function in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular  degeneration (AMD) by using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. DESIGN:  Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: A total of 41 eyes of 41  patients (75.8 {\textpm} 8.4 years old; 22 females) from a tertiary referral hospital  were included. Mesopic, dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were  assessed by using fundus-controlled perimetry (``microperimetry''); and retinal  microstructure was assessed by using spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography  (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and near-infrared-reflectance (IR)  imaging. Layer thicknesses and intensities and FAF and IR intensities were  extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) was  evaluated for random forest-based predictions of retinal sensitivity with and  without patient-specific training data and percentage of increased mean-squared  error ({\%}IncMSE) as measurement of feature importance. RESULTS: Retinal  sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic, 4.89 dB for DA cyan,  and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the absence of patient-specific data. Partial  addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased the  MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of testing, the outer  nuclear layer thickness constituted the most important predictive feature (35.0,  42.22, and 53.74 {\%}IncMSE). Spatially resolved mapping of ``inferred sensitivity''  revealed regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan sensitivity  loss outside of the GA lesions. CONCLUSIONS: ``Inferred sensitivity'' accurately  reflected retinal function in patients with GA. Mapping of ``inferred sensitivity''  could facilitate monitoring of disease progression and serve as ``quasi  functional'' surrogate outcome in clinical trials, especially in consideration of  retinal regions beyond areas of GA.",

abstract="BACKGROUND: To characterise early stages of geographic atrophy (GA) development  in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to determine the prognostic value  of structural precursor lesions in eyes with intermediate (i) AMD on the  subsequent GA progression. METHODS: Structural precursor lesions for atrophic  areas (lesion size at least 0.5{\thinspace}mm{\texttwosuperior} in fundus autofluorescence images) were  retrospectively identified based on multimodal imaging and evaluated for  association with the subsequent GA enlargement rates (square-root transformed,  sqrt). A linear mixed-effects model was used to account for the hierarchical  nature of the data with a Tukey post hoc test to assess the impact of the local  precursor on the subsequent GA progression rate. RESULTS: A total of 39 eyes with  GA of 34 patients with a mean age of 74.4{\textpm}6.7 ({\textpm}SD) years were included in this  study. Five precursor lesions (phenotypes 1-5) preceding GA development were  identified: large, sub-retinal pigment epithelial drusen (n=19), reticular  pseudodrusen (RPD, n=10), refractile deposits (n=4), pigment epithelial  detachment (n=4) and vitelliform lesions (n=2). Precursor lesions exhibited a  significant association with the subsequent (sqrt) GA progression rates  (p=0.0018) with RPD (phenotype 2) being associated with the fastest GA  enlargement (2.29{\textpm}0.52 ({\textpm}SE) mm/year.

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate characteristics of the foveal pit and the foveal  avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with Alport syndrome (AS), a rare monogenetic  disease due to mutations in genes encoding for collagen type IV. METHODS:  Twenty-eight eyes of nine patients with AS, and five autosomal-recessive carriers  and 15 eyes from 15 age-similar healthy control subjects were examined using  optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT-angiography (OCT-A). Foveal  configuration and FAZ measures including the FAZ area, circularity, and vessel  density in the central 1{\textdegree} and 3{\textdegree} were correlated. RESULTS: Foveal hypoplasia was  found in 10 eyes from seven patients with either genotype. In contrast, a  staircase foveopathy was found in seven eyes of four X-linked AS patients. The  average FAZ area did not differ significantly between AS patients and control  subjects (mean {\textpm} SD 0.24 {\textpm} 0.24 mm2 vs. 0.21 {\textpm} 0.09 mm2; P = 0.64). Five eyes  showed absence or severe anomalies of the FAZ with crossing macular capillaries  that was linked to the degree of foveal hypoplasia on OCT images leading to a  significant inverse correlation of FAZ area and foveal thickness (r = -0.88; P <  0.001). In contrary, female patients with X-linked mutations exhibited a  significantly greater FAZ area (0.48 {\textpm} 0.30 mm2 vs. 0.21 {\textpm} 0.09 mm2; P = 0.007),  in line with OCT findings of a staircase foveopathy. CONCLUSIONS: The foveal  phenotypic spectrum in AS ranges from foveal hypoplasia and absence of a FAZ to  staircase foveopathy with an enlarged FAZ. Because the development of the FAZ and  foveal pit are closely related, these findings suggest an important role for  collagen type IV in foveal development and maturation.",

abstract="Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are characterized by high clinical and  genetic heterogeneity. A precise characterization is desirable for diagnosis and  has impact on prognosis, patient counseling, and potential therapeutic options.  Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of in-depth retinal  phenotyping and molecular genetic testing in complex pedigrees with different  IRDs. Four affected Caucasians and two unaffected relatives were characterized  including multimodal retinal imaging, functional testing, and targeted  next-generation sequencing. A considerable intrafamilial phenotypic and genotypic  heterogeneity was identified. While the parents of the index family presented  with rod-cone dystrophy and ABCA4-related retinopathy, their two sons revealed  characteristics in the spectrum of incomplete congenital stationary night  blindness and ocular albinism, respectively. Molecular testing revealed  previously described variants in RHO, ABCA4, and MITF as well as a novel variant  in CACNA1F. Identified variants were verified by intrafamilial co-segregation,  bioinformatic annotations, and in silico analysis. The coexistence of four  independent IRDs caused by distinct mutations and inheritance modes in one  pedigree is demonstrated. These findings highlight the complexity of IRDs and  underscore the need for the combination of extensive molecular genetic testing  and clinical characterization. In addition, a novel variant in the CACNA1F gene  is reported associated with incomplete congenital stationary night blindness.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic, functional, and  imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy progression  secondary to maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD) and to evaluate  the application of these factors in clinical trial design. DESIGN: Retrospective  observational case series. METHODS: Thirty-five eyes of 20 patients (age range,  24.9-75.9 years) with genetically proven MIDD and demarcated RPE atrophy on  serial fundus autofluorescence (AF) images were included. Lesion size and  shape-descriptive parameters were longitudinally determined by 2 independent  readers. A linear mixed-effect model was used to predict the lesion enlargement  rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were performed to  model the power in a simulated interventional study. RESULTS: The mean follow-up  time was 4.27 years. The mean progression rate of RPE atrophy was  2.33 mm(2)/year, revealing a dependence on baseline lesion size (+0.04  [0.02-0.07] mm(2)/year/mm(2), P < .001), which was absent after square root  transformation. The fovea was preserved in the majority of patients during the  observation time. In the case of foveal involvement, the loss of visual acuity  lagged behind central RPE atrophy in AF images. Sex, age, and number of atrophic  foci predicted future progression rates with a cross-validated mean absolute  error of 0.13 mm/year and to reduce the required sample size for simulated  interventional trials. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive RPE atrophy could be traced in  all eyes using AF imaging. Shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline  characteristics had significant prognostic value, guiding appropriate subject  selection and sample size in future interventional trial design.",

METHODS: A total of 132 eyes of 66 patients with  ABCA4-related retinopathy were investigated using multimodal AF imaging and  spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Autofluorescence imaging with blue  (BAF), green (GAF), and near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by  a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF imaging obtained by  an innovative confocal light-emitting diode-based retinal imaging system  (Color-AF) that allows for separation of short (green emission fluorescent  component) and long (red emission fluorescent component) autofluorescence  emission components. RESULTS: Color-AF, BAF, and GAF, overall, revealed similar  presentation of hyperautofluorescent flecks. Flecks that showed predominantly red  emission fluorescent component matched with hyperautofluorescent flecks in  NIR-AF. Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months, flecks showed a transition  in the AF emission spectrum to shorter wavelengths (red emission fluorescent  component to green emission fluorescent component), associated with a progressed  disruption of overlaying outer retinal bands in optical coherence tomography.  Newer hyperautofluorescent flecks usually revealed predominantly red emission  fluorescent component. CONCLUSION: By separation of the AF spectra, the  remodeling of fluorophores and associated structural changes can be monitored  over time indicating a novel and susceptible surrogate marker for disease  progression and potential therapeutic effects.",

METHODS: In this prospective case-control study,  dark adaptation thresholds were measured using a Goldmann-Weekers dark  adaptometer. Additional assessments included best-corrected visual acuity  testing, contrast sensitivity, low luminance deficit, and vision-related quality  of life. RESULTS: Dark adaptation thresholds were significantly higher, and  adaptation periods were prolonged in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (n =  35; 33 with 2 ABCC6 mutations) compared with controls (n = 35). The time to adapt  4 log units (20.6 {\textpm} 8.6 vs. 8.0 {\textpm} 1.3 minutes) and the mean dark adaptation  threshold after 15 minutes (3.5 {\textpm} 1.1 vs. 1.8 {\textpm} 0.2 log units) were significantly  different between patients and controls (both P < 0.001). Low luminance deficits  (12.3 {\textpm} 6.4 vs. 6.1 {\textpm} 4.3 ETDRS letters), contrast sensitivity (1.4 {\textpm} 0.3 vs. 1.9  {\textpm} 0.1), and low luminance-related quality of life (LLQ score: 1,286 {\textpm} 355 vs.  2,167 {\textpm} 68) were also significantly worse in patients with pseudoxanthoma  elasticum (all, P < 0.001). Two patients were treated with high-dose vitamin A  which partially reversed impaired dark adaptation. CONCLUSION: Patients with  pseudoxanthoma elasticum often have impaired dark adaptation.

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate dark adaptation (DA) in patients with macular telangiectasia  Type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: After a local photobleach (4 {\texttimes} 4{\textdegree} size, 83{\%} bleach), DA  was measured using a test stimulus (2{\textdegree} diameter) projected at 5{\textdegree} eccentricity  horizontal from the foveal center within the temporal parafovea. Cone plateau,  rod intercept time, and rod recovery rate (S2) were calculated from the resulting  DA curves. Findings were correlated with disease stages (according to Gass and  Blodi), the area of ellipsoid zone loss in optical coherence tomography, and  macular pigment loss (``MP-Classes 1-3''). RESULTS: Fifty-nine eyes of 59 patients  were compared with 18 eyes of 18 healthy controls. Dark adaptation was  significantly impaired in patients with MacTel. Although differences were most  pronounced for parameters indicating rod-mediated recovery, cone-mediated  recovery was also decreased, yet to a lesser extent. Dark adaptation parameters  were only weakly associated with disease stages and ellipsoid zone loss. A better  association was found between rod-mediated recovery (S2 and rod intercept time)  and macular pigment loss (Kendall's tau for rod intercept time: 0.69 and S2:  -0.51; both P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Dark adaptation is significantly impaired in  patients with MacTel. Our results indicate an association of reduced macular  pigment and rod dysfunction in MacTel.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the association between the presence of type 1 choroidal  neovascularization (CNV) and the localized progression of atrophy in age-related  macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Analysis of patients' data collected in the  context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at the Department  of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes  diagnosed with AMD of 59 patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean ({\textpm}standard  deviation) age at baseline of 76.60{\textpm}6.65 years and median (interquartile range)  review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55) were included. Eyes were subdivided into  3 categories based on multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment  epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-na{\"{\i}}ve quiescent CNV (n=7), RPE atrophy  with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and RPE atrophy without evidence of  coexisting CNV (n=81). METHODS: Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated  on the basis of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance images.  If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its location and dimension were  spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The localized progression of RPE atrophy in  topographic relation to the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects  logistic regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and  observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in  areas overlying type 1 CNV. RESULTS: The prediction model achieved a high overlap  between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression with a cross-validated  Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a  high accuracy. The odds for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a  factor of 0.21 (95{\%} CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of treatment-na{\"{\i}}ve quiescent  type 1 CNV and by a factor of 0.46 (95{\%} CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of  exudative type 1 CNV. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is markedly  reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with quiescent and  exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is compatible with a potential protective  effect of type 1 CNV on the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results  may have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV and lead to new  therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: Based on exudative activity, choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can be classified as ``active'' aCNV,  pretherapied ``silent'' sCNV (i.e., a treatment-free interval >12 weeks), or  treatment-na{\"{\i}}ve ``quiescent'' qCNV. We evaluated the qualitative and quantitative  optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) features of these CNV subgroups.  METHODS: The presence of small-caliber vessels, peripheral arcades, and a  -perilesional OCTA signal attenuation as well as values for vessel length,  density, and branching index were evaluated for each CNV network in a 6 {\texttimes} 6 mm  OCTA scan pattern. RESULTS: Fifty-one eyes of 51 patients with AMD (age 75.9 {\textpm}  7.5 years; 20 males [39.2{\%}]) were included. The qCNV subgroup (n = 8) showed the  highest prevalence of qualitative and quantitative values for OCTA activity  criteria, reaching significance with regard to small-caliber vessels (p = 0.003),  peripheral arcades (p = 0.039), vessel length (p = 0.020), and branching index (p  < 0.001) when compared to the aCNV (n = 32) and sCNV (n = 11) subgroups.  Qualitative criteria were inversely associated with the number of previous  anti-VEGF injections (each p < 0.03), while quantitative metrics also suggested  lower values. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that OCTA may be supportive in  the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions secondary to AMD, while the  assessed structural changes appeared to be more indicative of previously  administered anti-VEGF therapy than current exudative activity.",

METHODS: At each annual follow-up visit, all subjects underwent  ophthalmic examination with assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and  retinal imaging, including spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), over a study period of 6  years. PURPOSE: To analyze longitudinal thickness changes of retinal layers in  comparison with established risk factors in eyes with age-related macular  degeneration (AMD) with regard to their prognostic value for conversion into  advanced AMD stages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative structural AMD features  and SD-OCT-based quantitative thickness changes of different retinal layers, such  as the retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC), were assessed by  multimodal imaging. Their prognostic relevance regarding disease conversion was  determined using Cox regression (cloglog link function). RESULTS: In the  multivariable analysis, the presence of focal hyperpigmentation, almost reaching  statistical significance, showed the strongest effect regarding the development  of nonexudative late-stage AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 5.88; 95{\%} confidence interval  [CI], 0.69-50.2; P = 0.052) followed by the presence of refractile drusen (HR,  4.82; 95{\%} CI, 1.33-17.44; P = 0.0164). A thickening of the RPEDC was the only  assessed retinal layer that exhibited a significant effect on the development of  nonexudative advanced AMD (HR, 1.03; 95{\%} CI, 1.0-1.07; P = 0.0393), whereas no  association was observable for the other retinal layers. Neither qualitative nor  quantitative markers were significant predictors for the development of exudative  late-stage AMD (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the development  of both exudative and nonexudative AMD is associated with distinct prognostic  features. However, compared with the assessment of qualitative AMD features, the  quantification of retinal layers on average across the central retina had less  prognostic impact. Further studies are needed to identify and validate robust  biomarkers in early AMD stages.",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate retinal sensitivity (RS) by mesopic and  scotopic microperimetry (MP-1S) in an elderly Amish population with age-related  macular degeneration (AMD). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mesopic and scotopic  microperimetric testing was performed in 148 eyes of 77 elderly Amish subjects  (age > 50 years) from Pennsylvania using a retinal function analyzer. Scotopic  testing was performed using a 2.0 log unit neutral density filter following 30  minutes of dark adaptation. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic  examinations, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus  autofluorescence, infrared reflectance imaging, and flash color fundus  photography. Certified graders at Doheny Image Reading Center identified subjects  with evidence of AMD as defined by the Beckman classification and quantified  drusen volume. RS in subjects with and without AMD was compared. Correlations  between RS and drusen burden were analyzed. Ten eyes with incomplete MP-1S exams  were excluded from the final analysis. RESULTS: Among the 138 eyes from 77  subjects included in the final analysis, 42 eyes from 29 subjects had evidence of  early or intermediate AMD. The mean age of subjects with AMD was 69.65 years {\textpm}  13.81 years versus 63.04 years {\textpm} 12.69 years in those without AMD (P = .06).  Mesopic RS was 18.8 dB {\textpm} 2.1 dB in subjects with AMD and 19.6 dB {\textpm} 1.4 dB in  those without AMD (P = .07). Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in  subjects with AMD (15.9 dB {\textpm} 2.9 dB) compared with those without AMD (17.3 dB {\textpm}  2.4 dB). There was no relationship between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r =  -0.06; P = .32) or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an  association between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39; P = .24) and  drusen volume (r = -0.36; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS: In an elderly Amish population,  eyes with early or intermediate AMD show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than  mesopic RS, suggesting that rod function is more severely affected than cone  function. Drusen area and volume measurements better correlated with scotopic RS.  [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2019;50:e236-e241.].",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate residual sensitivity within geographic atrophy (GA)  secondary to age-related macular degeneration. METHODS: Mesopic and dark-adapted  (DA) cyan and red light sensitivity (Goldmann III) were investigated using  fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry). Test points were placed within GA  along an ``iso-hull'' with a distance of -0.645{\textdegree} to the atrophy boundary. The  false-positive response rate was determined with suprathreshold stimuli to the  optic disc (Heijl-Krakau method) and used to compute the expected sensitivity  measurements for the assumption of absolute scotomata. The outermost visible  retinal layer on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography at the location of  each test point was determined. RESULTS: Thirty eyes of 36 patients (75.55 {\textpm} 7.93  years; 19 female) from the prospective natural history study Directional Spread  in Geographic Atrophy (NCT02051998), with a total of 1380 threshold  determinations were analyzed. The measured sensitivities were significantly (P <  0.01) higher than the expected values for absolute scotomata (mean {\textpm} standard  error of +6.92 {\textpm} 0.86 dB for mesopic, +2.57 {\textpm} 0.56 dB for DA cyan, and +4.93 {\textpm}  0.74 dB for DA red testing). For mesopic testing and DA red testing, the presence  of a residual outer nuclear layer had a significant effect on this discrepancy (P  < 0.001). There was no effect of fixation stability or any other reliability  index on this discrepancy. CONCLUSIONS: Measured sensitivities within the inner  junctional zone of GA may not be purely explained by patient-specific  false-positive response rates or other reliability indices. The marked influence  of the outer retinal configuration on measured sensitivity may be indicative of  residual cone function within GA at the inner junctional zone.",

There are numerous studies on the epidemiology of AMD. Most  studies differentiate between early and late forms of AMD, but without further  differentiation of the ``dry'' late form. In addition, different studies may employ  different classifications of AMD, which inevitably leads to deviations in  epidemiological data on AMD.

abstract="Spatially-resolved mapping of rod- and cone-function may facilitate monitoring of  macular diseases and serve as a functional outcome parameter. However, mesopic  and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called  ``microperimetry'') constitute laborious examinations. We have devised a  machine-learning-based approach to predict mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) retinal  sensitivity in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).  Extensive psychophysical testing and volumetric multimodal retinal imaging data  were acquired including mesopic, DA red and DA cyan FCP, spectral-domain optical  coherence tomography and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy infrared  reflectance and fundus autofluorescence imaging. With patient-wise leave-one-out  cross-validation, we have been able to achieve prediction accuracies of (mean  absolute error, MAE [95{\%} CI]) 3.94{\thinspace}dB [3.38, 4.5] for mesopic, 4.93{\thinspace}dB [4.59,  5.27] for DA cyan and 4.02{\thinspace}dB [3.63, 4.42] for DA red testing. Partial addition  of patient-specific sensitivity data decreased the cross-validated MAE to 2.8{\thinspace}dB  [2.51, 3.09], 3.71{\thinspace}dB [3.46, 3.96], and 2.85{\thinspace}dB [2.62, 3.08]. The most important  predictive feature was outer nuclear layer thickness. This artificial  intelligence-based analysis strategy, termed ``inferred sensitivity'', herein,  enables to estimate differential effects of retinal structural abnormalities on  cone- and rod-function in nAMD, and may be used as quasi-functional surrogate  endpoint in future clinical trials.",

abstract="IMPORTANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common threat to vision  loss in individuals older than 50 years. While neovascular complications in AMD  are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to  AMD. Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows considerable  interindividual variability, but little is known about prognostic factors.  OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic  atrophy lesion growth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled analysis  combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in  Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in  Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and  the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each provided data for  geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients with geographic  atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes were  retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or  generated at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). MAIN  OUTCOMES: The correlation between square root-transformed geographic atrophy  growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated  using linear regression. The calculations were adjusted for known factors  influencing geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral  geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and follow-up times.  MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Slopes per allele, 95{\%} CIs, and P values of genetic  variants correlated with geographic atrophy lesion growth. RESULTS: A total of  935 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female participants [59.0{\%}])  were included. Two gene loci with conservative genome-wide significance were  identified. Each minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased  the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15{\%} or 0.05 mm per year.  Gene prioritization within each locus suggests the protein arginine  methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome 1; slope, 0.046 [95{\%} CI,  0.026-0.066]; P{\thinspace}={\thinspace}4.09{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10-8) and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome  21; slope, 0.105 [95{\%} CI, 0.068-0.143]; P{\thinspace}={\thinspace}4.07{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10-7) as the most likely  progression-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data provide  further insight into the genetic architecture of geographic atrophy lesion  growth. Geographic atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for  effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising candidates for future  studies aimed at understanding functional aspects of geographic atrophy  progression and also for designing novel and targeted treatment options.",

abstract="PURPOSE: Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral neurodegenerative  disorder of the central macula. Previous findings indicated more functional  impairment in low light conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal  dysfunction using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (``scotopic  microperimetry''). METHODS: Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation  Registry study and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging  including dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD)  measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using  cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm). Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0  to 3). For perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel  minus controls) were compared at each test location and the results were  aggregated to global indices. RESULTS: Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age  62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both  cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more pronounced at one-  and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a  functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class  2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a  relatively higher cyan impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Rods might be compromised to a  greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also  hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease  stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect  functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease  progression.",

The minimal required reading rectangle (M3R),  19 letters {\texttimes} 2.4 lines in the smallest readable print size of an individual eye,  was computed. The status of the M3R was determined as either free of atrophy or  involved in the atrophic process, and the impact on reading was assessed. MAIN  OUTCOME MEASURES: Radner reading score (logRAD) and reading speed (words per  minute [wpm]). RESULTS: A total of 45 eyes of 31 patients (30 women; mean age,  76.14 years [range, 64.17-89.22 years]) were included. Median best-corrected  visual acuity was 0.20 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR;  Snellen equivalent, 20/32). Reading score was 0.52 logRAD (IQR, 0.30-1.4 logRAD)  and maximum reading speed was 141.19 wpm (IQR, 105.52-164.62 wpm). In 27 eyes,  the M3R was involved in the atrophic process. This was associated with a  significant worsening in Radner score (1.21 logRAD [IQR, 0.46-1.40 logRAD] vs.  0.31 logRAD [IQR, 0.20-0.51 logRAD]; P < 0.001) and reading speed (110.84 wpm  [IQR, 90.0-131.92 wpm] vs. 162.34 wpm [IQR, 137.51-176.66 wpm]; P = 0.002). Eyes  in which the M3R was nonatrophic additionally showed an increase in reading speed  with decreasing print size (peak increase, +73.08 wpm [IQR, 27.43-86.64 wpm]  compared with the largest test sentence). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that  a defined area on the retina that can be assessed by retinal imaging is required  for unhindered reading in patients with foveal-sparing GA. The findings highlight  that smaller test sentences can be read faster by patients with this AMD  subphenotype. Our results allow prediction of reading impairment based on imaging  parameters in clinical routine and may support establishing anatomic surrogate  end points in clinical trials. Furthermore, the findings could be used to  facilitate the adjustment of magnifying reading aids.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To determine the retest variability of mesopic and two-color  dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP), to evaluate the predictive  value of patient reliability indices, and to analyze the extent of impairment of  rod- and cone function in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).  METHODS: A total of 50 eyes of 50 patients with nAMD (mean age, 76.1 years) and  70 eyes of 70 age-similar normal subjects underwent multimodal imaging as well as  mesopic and DA two-color perimetry using the S-MAIA device. A subset of patients  (n = 28) underwent duplicate testing for retest reliability assessment. Mixed  models were used for analysis of the hierarchical data. RESULTS: In eyes with  nAMD, the coefficient of repeatability was (mean {\textpm} standard deviation [SD]) 5.99  {\textpm} 1.55 dB for mesopic, 6.14 {\textpm} 2.19 dB for DA cyan, and 6.06 {\textpm} 1.09 dB for DA red  testing. ``Patient reliability indices'' explained 55{\%}, 54.2{\%}, and 64.2{\%} of the  variance in retest variability. The mean sensitivity loss was greater for DA cyan  compared to DA red testing (cyan-red differences [mean {\textpm} SD] -2.63 {\textpm} 3.87 dB, P <  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively greater degree of DA cyan versus DA red  sensitivity loss indicates preferential rod vulnerability in nAMD, and qualifies  rod function-based outcomes measures as potential sensitive and early markers of  treatment response in nAMD. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The S-MAIA allows reliable  testing of mesopic, DA cyan, and DA red sensitivity in patients with nAMD.  Patient reliability indices may serve as eligibility criteria for clinical trials  to identify patients with adequate retest reliability.",

All patients underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic  stimuli, 400-800 nm) and dark-adapted (red stimuli, 627 nm) microperimetry, using  a grid of 33 stimuli over 14{\textdegree} of the central retina. Main outcome measure was the  intrasession test-retest reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS). RESULTS:  PWS test-retest reliability was good among mesopic and dark-adapted testing in  both patients and controls (coefficient of repeatability of 4.4, 4.52, 3.96, and  4.56 dB, respectively). Mean mesopic sensitivity in patients was 2.62 dB lower  than in controls (P < 0.01); mean dark-adapted sensitivity was 2.49 dB lower than  in controls (P < 0.01).

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate retinal sensitivity in the junctional zone of geographic  atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration using patient-tailored  perimetry grids for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled  perimetry. METHODS: Twenty-five eyes with GA of 25 patients (prospective,  natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study [DSGA;  NCT02051998]) and 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects were included. Patient-tailored  perimetry grids were generated using annotated fundus autofluorescence data.  Customized software positioned test-points along iso-hulls surrounding the GA  boundary at distances of 0.43{\textdegree}, 0.86{\textdegree}, 1.29{\textdegree}, 2.15{\textdegree}, and 3.01{\textdegree}. The grids were  used for duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-color (cyan and red)  fundus-controlled perimetry. Age-adjusted reference-data were obtained through  regression analysis of normative data followed by spatial interpolation. RESULTS:  The mean sensitivity loss for mesopic testing decreased with the distance to GA  (-10.3 dB [0.43{\textdegree}], -8.2 dB [0.86{\textdegree}], -7.1 dB [1.29{\textdegree}], -6.8 dB [2.15{\textdegree}], and -6.6 dB  [3.01{\textdegree}]; P < 0.01). Dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss exceeded dark-adapted red  sensitivity loss for all iso-hulls (-14.8 vs. -11.7 dB, -13.5 vs. -10.1 dB, -12.8  vs. -9.1 dB, -11.6 vs. -8.2 dB, -10.7 vs. -8.0 dB; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION:  Patient-tailored fundus-controlled perimetry grids allowed for testing of retinal  function in the junctional zone of GA with high spatial resolution. A distinct  decrease in mesopic sensitivity loss between 0.43{\textdegree} (125 {\textmu}m) and 1.29{\textdegree} (375 {\textmu}m)  was observed that leveled off at more distant test-points.

METHODS: In this cross-sectional case series, 97 eyes of 49 patients with RPE  atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy underwent GAF- (518 nm excitation  light) and BAF- (488 nm excitation light) imaging using confocal scanning laser  ophthalmoscopy (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).  Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and questionably  decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF imaging were analyzed separately  by five independent readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder,  Heidelberg Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were assessed  for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and circularity. RESULTS: GAF-  and BAF-based measurements of DDAF and QDAF showed high intermodality and  interreader agreement concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape  descriptive parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of  square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly higher for  GAF-based grading ([95{\%} coefficients of repeatability, intraclass correlation  coefficient] DDAF: 0.215 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based  grading (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However,  DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results than  QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with intermodality agreement.  CONCLUSIONS: Both GAF- and BAF-based quantification of RPE atrophy showed very  reliable results with possible superiority of GAF in the context of less  energetic excitation light. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The high interreader  agreement qualifies the use of DDAF progression in GAF and BAF imaging as  potential morphologic outcome measure for interventional clinical trials and  disease monitoring.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the choroidal blood flow in areas within and adjacent to  retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy secondary to late-onset Stargardt  disease (STGD1) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: A total of  43 eyes (23 STGD1 and 20 AMD) of patients with RPE atrophy and 25 eyes of healthy  controls without ocular pathology underwent multimodal imaging including optical  coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A; PLEX Elite 9000 Swept-Source OCT). Using  an exploratory approach, choriocapillaris and deeper choroid OCT-A slabs were  evaluated in order to detect differences between STGD1 and AMD. The magnitude of  absence-of-flow signal (AFS) was investigated in terms of area-fraction and  size-frequency distribution. RESULTS: Qualitative and quantitative analysis of  areas of RPE atrophy revealed more pronounced rarefaction of the choriocapillaris  flow signal in STGD1 as compared to AMD (AFS area fraction: 33.15{\%} {\textpm} 6.86{\%} vs.  31.68{\%} {\textpm} 8.39{\%}; P = 0.517), while outside RPE atrophy rarefaction was less  pronounced in STGD1 (AFS area fraction: 17.41{\%} {\textpm} 5.67{\%} vs. 21.59{\%} {\textpm} 6.90{\%}; P <  0.001), to the level of nonsignificance compared to controls (13.27{\%} {\textpm} 2.99{\%}, P =  0.368). Given this discrepancy, the ratio of the AFS area fraction within/outside  of RPE atrophy could be used to differentiate between STGD1 and AMD with 65.0{\%}  sensitivity and 92.3{\%} specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Using OCT-A, comparison of  choroidal flow signal within and outside the area of RPE atrophy revealed  distinct differences between STGD1 and AMD, potentially implicating a  differential role of the choroid in the pathogenesis of RPE atrophy in these two  diseases.",

METHODS: Forty-four eyes (24 eyes of 24  patients with drusen, age 69.4{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}12.6 years; 20 normal eyes of 16 subjects,  61.7{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}12.4 years) underwent duplicate mesopic, dark-adapted cyan and  dark-adapted red FCP within 14{\textdegree} of the central retina (total of 12{\thinspace}936 threshold  tests) using the Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment (S-MAIA, CenterVue,  Padova, Italy) device. FCP data were registered to SD-OCT data to obtain outer  nuclear layer, inner and outer photoreceptor segment, and retinal pigment  epithelium drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness data spatially corresponding to the  stimulus location and area (0.43{\textdegree}). Structure-function correlations were assessed  using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Mean deviation values for eyes with  cuticular, soft, and reticular drusen were similar for mesopic (-2.1, -3.4, and  -3.6{\thinspace}dB) and dark-adapted red (-1.4, -2.6, and -3.3{\thinspace}dB) FCP. For the dark-adapted  cyan FCP (0.1, -1.9, and -5.0{\thinspace}dB) and for the cyan-red sensitivity difference  (+1.0, +0.5, and -2.4{\thinspace}dB), the mean deviation values differed significantly in  dependence of the predominant drusen type (one-way ANOVA; p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.05). RPEDC  thickness was associated with reduction of mesopic sensitivity (-0.34{\thinspace}dB/10{\thinspace}{\textmu}m  RPEDC thickening; p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001), dark-adapted cyan sensitivity (-0.11{\thinspace}dB/10{\thinspace}{\textmu}m RPEDC  thickening; p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.003), and dark-adapted red sensitivity (-0.26{\thinspace}dB/10{\thinspace}{\textmu}m RPEDC  thickening; p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to mesopic FCP, dark-adapted  two-color FCP allowed for meaningful differential testing of rod and cone  function in patients with drusen indicating predominant cone dysfunction in eyes  with cuticular drusen and predominant rod dysfunction in eyes with reticular  drusen. RPEDC thickness was the strongest predictor of the evaluated SD-OCT  biomarkers for point-wise sensitivity.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the involvement of the retinal and choriocapillaris  microvasculature in intermediate uveitis on optical coherence tomography  angiography (OCT-A). DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Patients and  age-matched controls were imaged with swept-source OCT-A. Using ImageJ,  superficial and deep retinal vasculature were semi-automatically analyzed for  vessel (VD) and skeleton density (SD), vessel diameter index (VDI), and fractal  dimension (FD). Choriocapillaris layer was automatically graded for mean signal  intensity, signal intensity standard deviation, kurtosis of signal intensity  distribution, and flow signal voids. RESULTS: Twenty-nine intermediate uveitis  eyes and 30 control eyes were included. Both superficial and deep retinal layers  showed significant reduction in all OCT-A parameters (eg, superficial retinal  layer: 0.31 vs 0.40 VD, 5.6e(-8) vs 6.4e(-8) SD, 5.4e(6) vs 6.1e(6) VDI, and 1.78  vs 1.79 FD, respectively, all P < .05). At the choriocapillaris layer a greater  heterogeneity of perfusion with a shift toward a higher proportion of large  confluent flow signal voids was present. Also in the absence of macular edema  OCT-A parameters were reduced when compared with healthy controls (all parameters  except for VDI in the superficial retinal layer and the choriocapillaris kurtosis  and flow signal void analyses). CONCLUSIONS: In intermediate uveitis, reduced  vascular density and complexity in superficial as well as deep retinal layers and  altered choriocapillaris perfusion are present. Moreover, these findings indicate  impairment of the macular microvasculature even in the absence of macular edema.  The results of our study may aid in the diagnosis as well as the monitoring of  intermediate uveitis.",

METHODS: A total  of 296 eyes of 201 patients (female patients 130; mean age: 72.2 {\textpm} 13.08 years)  with a median follow-up of 2.38 years from 2 prospective, noninterventional  natural history studies  (Fundus-Autofluorescence-in-Age-related-Macular-Degeneration [clinicaltrials.gov  identifier NCT00393692], Directional-Spread-in-Geographic-Atrophy [NCT02051998])  were included in the analysis. Serial fundus autofluorescence images were  annotated using semiautomated image analysis software to determine the lesion  area, circularity, perimeter, and caliper diameters. These variables and the  fundus autofluorescence phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future  square root progression rates using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: For the  combined model, leave-one-out cross validation on patient level (Scenario 1:  previously unknown patient) resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and  leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2: previous observation  of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This indicated that shape-descriptive  factors could explain 24.4{\%} of the variance in geographic atrophy progression in  previously unknown patients and 39.1{\%} in patients with previous observation.  CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the relevance of shape-descriptive factors and  previous progression as prognostic variables for geographic atrophy progression.  However, a substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic atrophy  progression seems to depend on other variables, some of which are visible in  optical coherence tomography.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To examine the topographic correlation between retinal morphology and  retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in  eyes with intermediate AMD. METHODS: Thirty-five eyes from 32 patients (mean age  70.9 years) and 29 age-matched controls prospectively underwent spectral-domain  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Mesopic (Goldman III, 200 ms, 4-2  strategy) and scotopic (Goldman V, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) FCP with a 56-stimulus  point grid was performed in AMD patients with the MP-1S. Thickness values of  different retinal layers were measured at each stimulus point and compared,  topographically corresponding to values in controls of similar age for pointwise  structural-functional analysis. RESULTS: The overall mean sensitivity in patients  was 16.9 {\textpm} 3.0 dB for mesopic and 14.0 {\textpm} 3.7 dB for scotopic testing. Within the  central 4{\textdegree} of the macula, reduced mesopic and scotopic sensitivity values were  found (P < 0.0001). These findings correlated to central increasing retinal  pigment epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness and central decreasing outer  nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor (PR)-segments thickness (P < 0.0001,  respectively). Structure-function correlations revealed that a reduction of  mesopic and scotopic sensitivity was associated with increasing thickness of the  total retina and the RPEDC and a decrease of the ONL and the PR-segments (P <  0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Accumulation of sub-RPE material in patients  with intermediate AMD is spatially associated to quantifiable structural  alterations in various retinal layers and to corresponding retinal dysfunction.  The topographic analysis of retinal thickness and retinal sensitivity will be  helpful for a better understanding of the disease process and for the evaluation  of new interventional approaches.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the impact of distinct atrophy border characteristics based on  spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging on local atrophy  progression. METHODS: Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to AMD were  recruited in the context of the Longitudinal Fundus Autofluorescence in  Age-related Macular Degeneration and Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy  studies (NCT00393692, NCT02051998). Horizontal and vertical SD-OCT scans were  acquired at sequential visits using a device allowing for anatomically accurate  registration of follow-up to baseline scans. For quantification of local atrophy  progression, the lateral spread of GA (LSGA) was measured. Further, border types  were independently graded. Comparison of LSGA between the different border types  was performed using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Seventy-two eyes of 49  patients (27 female) aged 74.0 years (Inter quartile range [IQR], 68.1-79.0) were  included into this analysis. A total of 258 border sections were analyzed  longitudinally over a median period of 1.2 years (IQR, 0.9-1.6). At baseline,  17.1{\%} borders were classified as 'regular', 47.7{\%} as 'irregular', and 35.3{\%} as  'splitting'. Sixty-two percent of the eyes exhibited more than one border type.  LSGA was slowest in 'regular' borders (62.85 {\textpm} 25.29 $\mu$m/y), followed by  'irregular' borders (91.15 {\textpm} 15.05 $\mu$m/y) and fastest in 'splitting' borders  (183.15 {\textpm} 18.17 $\mu$m/y). Differences between the 'splitting' and each other border  type were statistically significant (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The results  indicate that SD-OCT-based assessment of local GA border morphology can serve as  a predictor for local atrophy progression. These observations help to better  understand the natural history and potential pathogenetic factors of GA  development and progression.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the development of central atrophy in eyes with age-related  macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Six-year longitudinal multimodal retinal  imaging data (MODIAMD study) from 98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD  in the study eye at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at  each annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and further progression  of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by  multimodal imaging data were compared with atrophy detection based on color  fundus photography only. RESULTS: Seventeen study eyes with development of  central cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4{\%}) were identified based on  multimodal imaging. In 10 (60{\%}) of these eyes, presence of central manifest  atrophy was initially not detectable by color fundus photography. In six (35{\%})  eyes, central cRORA occurred by the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward  the fovea. Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In two  eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile deposits, while only  pigmentary changes in absence of large drusen or refractile deposits were  detectable before atrophy occurrence in one eye. CONCLUSIONS: The earlier and  more precise detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to  atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows for more  accurate detection and identification of different pathways for atrophy  development. In accordance with previous clinical and histopathologic reports,  the results confirm that different precursor lesions may independently proceed to  central cRORA in AMD.",

METHODS: The data of 38  eyes of 38 AMD patients (age 69.97 {\textpm} 6.08 years) were included. The longitudinal  drusen volume over 4 years was analyzed by annual SD-OCT raster scanning (field  size 20 {\texttimes} 15{\textdegree}). Two raster scan patterns (A/B) differed in the distance between  neighboring B-scans (240 vs. 30 {\textmu}m) and in the number of averaged frames (4 vs.  15). RESULTS: The mean drusen volume at baseline was 0.213 {\textpm} 0.100 mm3 (pattern  A) and 0.219 {\textpm} 0.103 mm3 (pattern B) (p = 0.937). Linear mixed-effect models  showed no significant difference for the change within 4 years for both pattern A  (p = 0.8) and pattern B (p = 0.8).

abstract="BACKGROUND/AIMS: To analyse the retest reliability of visual field indices and to  describe patterns of visual field deficits in mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour  fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in macular diseases. METHODS: Seventy-seven  eyes (30 eyes with macular diseases and 47 normal eyes) underwent duplicate  mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour FCP (Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment,  CenterVue). Non-weighted (mean defect, loss variance), variability-weighted (mean  deviation, pattern standard deviation (PSD)) and graphical (cumulative defect  (Bebie) curves) indices were computed. Reproducibility (coefficient of  repeatability, CoR) of these indices was assessed. Cluster analysis was carried  out to identify patterns of visual field deficits. RESULTS: The intrasession  reproducibility was lower for the mean defect as compared with the mean deviation  (CoR (dB) 2.67 vs 2.57 for mesopic, 1.71 vs 1.45 for dark-adapted cyan, 1.94 vs  1.87 for dark-adapted red testing) and lower for the square-root loss variance as  compared with the PSD (CoR (dB) 1.48 vs 1.34, 0.77 vs 0.65, 1.23 vs 1.03).  Hierarchical cluster analysis of the indices disclosed six patterns of visual  field deficits (approximately unbiased P value>0.95) with varying degrees of  global versus focal defect and rod versus cone dysfunction. These were also  reflected by the cumulative defect curves. CONCLUSION: FCP with mesopic and  dark-adapted two-colour testing allows for reproducible assessment of different  types of retinal sensitivity, whereby mean deviation and PSD exhibited the better  retest reliability of the tested indices. Distinct patterns of retinal  dysfunction can be identified using this setup, reflecting variable degrees of  rod and cone dysfunction in different macular diseases. Dark-adapted two-colour  FCP provides additional diagnostic information and allows for refined  structure-function correlation in macular diseases.",

abstract="BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To quantify vessel density (VD) and grey value (GV) as  a measure of flow in the choriocapillaris (CC) in healthy subjects with optical  coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this  prospective, noncomparative case series, 3 mm {\texttimes} 3 mm OCTA images of 36 eyes of 22  healthy individuals were obtained using a swept-source instrument. VD and GV  levels were calculated on CC en face slabs in the central 1-mm (subfoveal field)  and surrounding 2.5-mm parafoveal ring. VD was calculated as a ratio of vessel  area over nonvessel area following image binarization. GV was computed as the  mean, un-normalized greyscale intensity value for all pixels in the region of  interest. For each eye, the procedure was repeated 1 minute to 2 minutes later  and intersession repeatability was analyzed. The choroidal thickness (CT) was  automatically measured in the subfoveal and parafoveal regions and compared to VD  and GV values. RESULTS: The VD ratio and GV was lower in the subfoveal field than  in the parafoveal four sectors. The intersession intraclass correlation  coefficients were high for both VD and GV measurements. There was no correlation  observed between CT and VD or GV. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative metrics can be  obtained from CC OCTA en face images. These values show moderate to good  intersession repeatability. These normative data may be of value as a reference  of comparison in future studies of eyes with disease.

METHODS: Eleven eyes from 11 patients underwent mesopic and,  after 30 minutes of dark adaptation, scotopic (MP-1S: Goldmann V, 200 ms,  background luminance 0.0032 cd/m(2); S-MAIA: Goldman III, 200 ms, background  luminance <0.0001 cd/m(2)) FCP. For the S-MAIA device, cyan (505 nm) and red (627  nm) scotopic FCP were performed. For both devices, a grid of 56 stimulus points  covering 16{\textdegree} of the central macula was used. Examination time, fixation  stability, and threshold values were analyzed. RESULTS: The upper end of the  dynamic range (≤4 dB of lowest threshold) was frequently reached by the MP-1S for  mesopic testing (median 34 of 56 stimuli), while threshold values within the  lower 4 dB of the dynamic range were occasionally found with the S-MAIA for  scotopic testing (median 3 for cyan, median 2 for red). After correction of the  stimulus intensity for the S-MAIA results, the median difference for all stimuli  between both devices for mesopic testing was -2.0 dB (interquartile range [-4;0],  range -14 to 6). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that robust testing of mesopic  and scotopic function is feasible with both devices in patients with AMD,  although both devices are susceptible to floor and ceiling effects. TRANSLATIONAL  RELEVANCE: The interpretation and particularly the comparison of both scotopic  and mesopic FCP results between the MP-1S and the S-MAIA in AMD eyes need to  consider variable susceptibility of floor and ceiling effects. Further software  updates are desirable as FCP captures visual functional loss that is not noted  with best-corrected central visual acuity and is important for clinical trials in  AMD.",

Procedimientos: La angio-OCT se llev{\'o} a cabo mediante el  sistema Avanti® RTVue 100 XR (Optovue Inc., Fremont, Calif., EE. UU.). Los bordes  de la capa vascular superficial (CVS) se definieron como 3 $\mu$m por debajo de la  membrana limitante interna y 15 $\mu$m por debajo de la capa plexiforme interna y,  para la capa vascular profunda (CVP), como 15 y 70 $\mu$m por debajo de la membrana  limitante interna y de la capa plexiforme interna, respectivamente.

METHODS: In this prospective cross-sectional  study, each of the 52 eyes of 52 subjects with various macular diseases (mean age  62.0 {\textpm} 16.9 years; range, 19.1-90.1 years) underwent duplicate mesopic  (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), dark-adapted cyan (505 nm), and dark-adapted  red (627 nm) FCP using a grid of 61 stimuli covering 18{\textdegree} of the central retina.  The EDR, the number of DS, and the retest reliability for point-wise sensitivity  (PWS) were analyzed. The effects of fixation stability, sensitivity, and age on  retest reliability were examined using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: The EDR was  10 to 30 dB with five DS for mesopic and 4 to 17 dB with four DS for dark-adapted  cyan and red testing. PWS retest reliability was good among all three types of  retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient of repeatability {\textpm}5.79, {\textpm}4.72, and  {\textpm}4.77 dB, respectively) and did not depend on fixation stability or age. PWS had  no effect on retest variability in dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red testing  but had a minor effect in mesopic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Combined mesopic and  dark-adapted two-color FCP allows for reliable topographic testing of cone and  rod function in patients with various macular diseases with and without foveal  fixation. Retest reliability is homogeneous across eccentricities and various  degrees of scotoma depth, including zones at risk for disease progression. These  reliability estimates can serve for the design of future clinical trials.",

Thickness and reflectivity of  the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-basal lamina complex, as well as the  integrity of the external limiting membrane (ELM) and the ellipsoid zone (EZ),  respectively, in corresponding optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were  compared between the time points before and after the appearance of increased  FAF. Adjacent areas without development of abnormal FAF were assessed as internal  control. RESULTS: A total of 36 areas (15 eyes) with de novo developed increased  FAF spots and 54 control areas were included. Analysis of the corresponding OCT  images revealed an increase in RPE-basal lamina complex thickness (31.8 {\textpm} 7.3 to  42.1 {\textpm} 11.9 $\mu$m [P < 0.001]) and reflectivity (reflectivity ratio: 1.42 {\textpm} 0.11 to  1.54 {\textpm} 0.27 [P = 0.009]) corresponding to an increased FAF signal while there was  no significant change in control areas. Development of increased FAF spots was  associated with disruption of the ELM and the EZ. CONCLUSIONS: Increase of  RPE-basal lamina complex thickness and reflectivity was spatially and temporally  associated with the development of increased FAF spots in eyes with GA. In  addition, outer retinal disruption may contribute to the corresponding increased  FAF signal.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To compare the intermodality and interreader agreement for geographic  atrophy (GA) lesion size quantification in green-light fundus autofluorescence  (GAF; excitation = 518 nm) versus combined blue-light fundus autofluorescence  (BAF; excitation = 488 nm) and near-infrared reflectance (NIR; 820 nm) -based  grading. METHODS: Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) GAF, BAF, and NIR  images of 40 eyes from 29 patients (mean age 79.7 years) with GA secondary to AMD  were recorded according to a standardized protocol. GA areas were analyzed in  GAF, BAF combined with NIR (BAF+NIR), or BAF alone, by four independent readers  using semiautomated software (RegionFinder; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg,  Germany). A mixed-effects model was used to assess the effect of image modality  on the measured square-root lesion area. The coefficient of repeatability (CR)  and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were assessed for the square-root  lesion area, lesion perimeter, and circularity. RESULTS: GAF-based measurements  were on average 0.062 mm (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than  BAF+NIR-based measurements and 0.077 mm (95{\%} CI 0.06 - 0.10 mm) larger than  BAF-based measurements. Interreader agreement was highest for GAF-based analysis  ([CR, ICC] 0.196 mm, 0.995) followed by BAF+NIR (0.232 mm, 0.992) and BAF alone  (0.263 mm, 0.991). The same was noted for the lesion perimeter and circularity.  Post hoc review revealed that interreader differences were associated with media  opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation to a larger extent in  BAF than in GAF. CONCLUSIONS: cSLO-based GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging with  semiautomated lesion delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible  quantification of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF  suggests that its use may be preferable in clinical trials examining the change  in lesion size as a clinical endpoint.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To identify predictors of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes  with foveal-sparing geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular  degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Best corrected visual acuity (Early Treatment  Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts); serial fundus autofluorescence; and  near-infrared reflectance images of patients participating in the FAM  (NCT00393692) and DSGA (NCT02051998) studies were analyzed. The sizes of GA and  spared fovea, and the minimal linear dimension of intact retinal pigment  epithelium (``bridge'') between the residual foveal island and the surrounding  retina were quantified and associations with BCVA were assessed by local  regression curves and mixed effects models. RESULTS: A total of 65 eyes (51  patients, aged 75.68 {\textpm} 8.41 years) were included. Median time between baseline  and last visit with detectable foveal sparing was 18 (quartiles: 12, 33) months.  Median BCVA was 0.30 (0.20, 0.52) logMAR at baseline and 0.4 (0.3, 0.7) logMAR at  follow-up. Local regression curves suggested no linear association of BCVA with  GA size, sparing size or bridge size. Most contrasting values for BCVA were  observed for >1.5 mm2 foveal-sparing size and for 400 $\mu$m bridge size. Employing  these values as cutoff levels, mixed effects modeling revealed that both anatomic  parameters, but not time, significantly impacted BCVA. CONCLUSIONS: During the  review period eyes with foveal-sparing GA were likely to maintain the baseline  BCVA. There was no linear correlation of BCVA with foveal-sparing size. Yet, BCVA  was worse if the spared foveal area was <1.5 mm2 or if the bridge was smaller  than 400 $\mu$m in width. These findings add to the understanding of the natural  history of foveal-sparing GA and may support future clinical trial designs.",

With AO ophthalmoscopes, the microscopic retinal structure can be  visualised non-invasively and on a cellular level, allowing for cellular scale  imaging of the retinal nerve fibre layer, the smallest retinal capillaries, rod  and cone photoreceptors, and the retinal pigment epithelium mosaic in the living  subject. Regarding the diagnostic evaluation of retinal diseases, the current  research focuses on monogenetic retinal diseases, which - when better understood  - may allow for conclusions to be drawn about other multifactorial diseases and  their underlying mechanisms (model disease). For disease monitoring and current  and future pharmacological intervention (e.g. gene therapy), they will help to  better establish novel and reliable clinical endpoints. New AO imaging devices  have just become commercially available, and the number of retinal pathologies  visualised with AO is increasing. Recently, an AO-based microstimulation  technique has been introduced, which offers the possibility to directly correlate  retinal structure with visual function on a cellular level.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility of intraretinal hard exudate (HE)  quantification from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images  of eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: Cases with diabetic macular  edema were enrolled. The area of HE obtained by B-scan segmentation was compared  with the area obtained by en face segmentation. RESULTS: The mean {\textpm} SD for the HE  area was 1.78 {\textpm} 1.37 mm with B-scan segmentation and 0.72 {\textpm} 0.82 mm with the  automated en face analysis tool; the absolute difference was 1.01 {\textpm} 0.64 mm.  There was excellent correlation in total HE area between the two methods (r =  0.95, P < 0.0001). The HE volume was 0.06 {\textpm} 0.07 mm. The correlation between HE  volume and en face HE area was high (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). Intergrader  reproducibility yielded excellent agreement with an intraclass correlation  coefficient value of 0.99 (95{\%} CI 0.994-0.999) for the en face approach and 0.99  (95{\%} CI 0.977-0.997) for manual segmentation. CONCLUSION: Quantification of HE in  eyes with diabetic retinopathy can be performed reliably using en face  segmentation and, though the en face results are consistently lower, correlates  well with HE measurements obtained by exhaustive segmentation of all B-scans in  dense volume optical coherence tomography (OCT).",

abstract="PURPOSE: To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of scotopic cyan and  scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in normal subjects using a  modified MAIA ``microperimeter'' (macular integrity assessment) device. METHODS:  Forty-seven normal eyes of 30 subjects (aged 33.8 years) underwent duplicate  mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505 nm), and scotopic  red (627 nm) FCP, using a grid of 49 stimuli over 14{\textdegree} of the central retina.  Test-retest reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation,  reaction time and test duration were analyzed using mixed-effects models.  RESULTS: PWS test-retest reliability was good among all 3 types of retinal  sensitivity assessments (coefficient of repeatability of 4.75 dB for mesopic,  5.26 dB for scotopic cyan, and 4.06 dB for scotopic red testing). While the mean  sensitivity decreased with eccentricity for both mesopic and scotopic red  testing, it was highest at 7{\textdegree} eccentricity for the scotopic cyan assessment (p <  0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The modified MAIA device allows for reliable scotopic FCP in  normal subjects. Our findings suggest that testing of scotopic cyan sensitivity  largely reflects rod function.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To investigate the potential of optical coherence tomography (OCT)  angiography to detect and quantify the neovascular network in exudative AMD.  METHODS: Treatment-na{\"{\i}}ve eyes that were diagnosed with exudative AMD were  prospectively examined by OCT angiography (OCT-A). The extent of the neovascular  network was measured by three independent readers. Interclass-correlation  coefficient and area overlap coefficients (OC) were calculated to assess locally  precise agreement between measurements. As a reference for interreader agreement,  the extent of the neovascular network was further measured on fluorescein  angiography (FA) images. RESULTS: A total of 31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5  years, 15 female) were included in the study. Neovascularization subtype was  classified as type I in 5, type II in 11, type III in 9, and mixed in 6 eyes,  respectively. Interreader agreement for measurements of the neovascular network  was 0.884 for OCT-A and 0.636 for FA. Overlap coefficient was 0.705  (interquartile [IQR]: 0.450-0.76) for OCT-A and 0.704 (IQR: 0.673-0.750) for FA,  respectively. Area agreement was weaker in type III and mixed lesions.  CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography angiography-based measurements of the  new vessel complex in neovascular AMD are feasible with interreader agreement  comparable with the values obtained for FA. The results underscore the potential  of OCT-A as a noninvasive diagnostic tool in neovascular AMD. Yet, further  studies will be required to reveal the origin of poor agreement observed in  single eyes and to advance OCT-A toward dependable use (e.g., in a reading center  context).",

METHODS: Images (a 3 {\texttimes} 3 mm cube centered on the  fovea) were acquired in 40 eyes of 22 normal individuals and 28 eyes of 18  patients with varying levels of DR using a swept-source OCT-A device (central  wavelength 1050 nm; A-scan-rate of 100,000 scans per second). En face images of  the retinal vasculature were generated from the superficial and deep retinal  layers (SRL/DRL). Quantitative analysis of the vessel density (VD) and FAZ area  was performed. Vessel density was assessed as the ratio of the retinal area  occupied by vessels. RESULTS: Among the DR subjects (mean age, 72 years; 61{\%}  male), 35.7{\%} of the eyes had mild, 35.7{\%} moderate, and 7.1{\%} severe  nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 21.4{\%} and proliferative DR (PDR). The mean FAZ  area in patients with DR and in normal individuals was 0.518 and 0.339 mm2,  respectively, for the SRL (P = 0.003), and 0.615 and 0.358 mm2, respectively, for  the DRL (P < 0.001). The mean VD (ratio) at the SRL and DRL was statistically  significantly lower in patients with DR (SRL, P < 0.001; DRL, P = 0.028).  CONCLUSIONS: Swept-source OCT-A of the microcirculation in eyes of patients with  DR can be used to quantitatively demonstrate alterations in the FAZ and VD in the  SRL/DRL of the macula compared to normal eyes. Future longitudinal studies may  use these metrics to evaluate changes over time or in response to treatment.",

abstract="PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to visualize and to quantify pathological  foveal avascular zone (FAZ) alterations through optical coherence tomography  angiography (OCT-A) in eyes with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in comparison to  the unaffected fellow eyes. PROCEDURES: OCT-A was conducted with the Avanti®  RTVue 100 XR system (Optovue Inc., Fremont, Calif., USA). The borders of the  superficial vascular layer (SVL) were defined as 3 $\mu$m below the internal limiting  membrane and 15 $\mu$m below the inner plexiform layer, and for the deep vascular  layer (DVL) as 15 and 70 $\mu$m below the inner plexiform layer, respectively. The  length of the horizontal, vertical and maximum FAZ was manually measured for the  SVL and DVL in each eye. Additionally, the angle between the maximum FAZ diameter  and the papillomacular plane was measured. RESULTS: OCT-A depicted defects within  the perifoveal vasculature in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO; n =  11) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO; n = 8). These resulted in an  enlargement of the maximum FAZ diameter in eyes with RVO (n = 19) in comparison  to the healthy fellow eyes (n = 19; 921 {\textpm} 213 vs. 724 {\textpm} 145 {\textmu}m; p = 0.008).  Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between best-corrected visual  acuity (BCVA) and the maximum FAZ diameter in the DVL (Spearman's x03C1; =  -0.423, p < 0.01). Lastly, in the eyes with RVO, the angle between the  papillomacular plane and the maximum FAZ diameter was only in 21.05{\%} (SVL) and  15.79{\%} (DVL) of the cases at 0 {\textpm} 15 or 90 {\textpm} 15{\textdegree}, respectively. In healthy eyes,  these angles (which putatively represent a regular FAZ configuration) were more  prevalent (SVL 68.42 vs. 21.05{\%}, p = 0.003; DVL 73.68 vs. 15.79{\%}, p < 0.001).  CONCLUSION: OCT-A shows morphological alterations of the FAZ in eyes with CRVO  and BRVO. The correlation of the maximum FAZ diameter with BCVA suggests that  these alterations are functionally relevant.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To genetically characterize a subphenotype of geographic atrophy (GA) in  AMD associated with rapid progression and a diffuse-trickling appearance on  fundus autofluorescence imaging. METHODS: Patients from the Fundus  Autofluorescence in Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study were phenotyped for  diffuse-trickling GA (dt-GA; n = 44). DNA was analyzed for 10 known  AMD-associated genetic variants. A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated and  compared with patients with nondiffuse-trickling GA (ndt-GA; n = 311) and  individuals from the 1000 genomes project (1000G; n = 267). Given the phenotypic  overlap between diffuse-trickling and late-onset retinal degeneration (LORD), all  C1QTNF5 exons and their exon/intron boundaries were sequenced. RESULTS: A  statistically significant difference in allele frequencies between dt-GA and  ndt-GA were found for CFH:rs1061170 and CFH:rs800292 (Pcorrected = 0.03). The  ARMS2 variant rs10490924 was significantly more frequent in dt-GA than in 1000G  individuals (Pcorrected < 0.01). The GRS of dt-GA patients was in-between the  score of the 1000G individuals and that of patients with ndt-GA, significantly  differing from both (Pcorrected <0.01). Sequencing of C1QTNF5 revealed 28 unique  variants although none showed a statistically significant association with dt-GA  when compared with 1000G individuals. CONCLUSIONS: The dt-GA phenotype shows a  remarkably different genetic risk profile from other GA phenotypes secondary to  AMD. Disease-associated C1QTNF5 mutations were not identified. Together, these  results suggest that the dt-GA phenotype is associated with a genetic background  substantially different from other GA phenotypes and underlines the necessity to  refine the clinical phenotyping, specifically when aiming for individualized  therapies in AMD.",

PATIENTS  AND METHODS: 96 eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) were  included, which had been pretreated with ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (T{\&}E),  but had responded insufficiently. An injection interval of less than six weeks or  permanently persisting intra- and/or subretinal fluid or persistent pigment  epithelial detachments (PED) were defined as an insufficient response. The  patients were followed for 12 months after switching therapy to aflibercept. The  change in central retinal thickness (CRT) was defined as the primary endpoint.  Other endpoints were the axial height of PEDs and the injection interval.  RESULTS: The primary endpoint, the average CRT, was significantly decreased  twelve months after switching therapy to aflibercept (Wilcoxon  Nemenyi-McDonald-Thompson post-hoc analysis -{\thinspace}31.36{\thinspace}{\textmu}m; SD {\textpm}{\thinspace}70.64{\thinspace}{\textmu}m;  p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001). Another morphological endpoint, the average axial height of PEDs,  also decreased significantly (-{\thinspace}34.10{\thinspace}{\textmu}m; SD {\textpm}{\thinspace}91.90{\thinspace}{\textmu}m, p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001) from  207.82{\thinspace}{\textmu}m (SD {\textpm}{\thinspace}148.12{\thinspace}{\textmu}m) at baseline to 173.72{\thinspace}{\textmu}m (SD {\textpm}{\thinspace}132.30{\thinspace}{\textmu}m) at month 12.  Moreover, the average injection interval increased significantly (p{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}0.001;  Friedman test) from 1.30 months (SD {\textpm}{\thinspace}0.19 months) before switching therapy to  1.67 months (SD {\textpm}{\thinspace}0.19 months) at month 12 after switching therapy to  aflibercept. However, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) as a functional  endpoint did not significantly improve (+{\thinspace}0.36 ETDRS letters{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.0972{\thinspace}p; SD  {\textpm}{\thinspace}16.94 ETDRS letters). CONCLUSION: In patients with neovascular AMD, who had  initially exhibited an inadequate response to ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab,  switching therapy to aflibercept improves clinical outcome measures. Besides  morphological improvements, such as the decrease of the CRT and the axial height  of PEDs, the average injection interval was prolonged. However, visual acuity did  not improve.",

PATIENTS AND  METHODS: The Rescan 700 iOCT (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), a spectral-domain OCT  system integrated into a surgical microscope, was used in 40 consecutive cases. A  standardized review was used to assess whether iOCT imaging resulted in  additional information and/or altered decision-making. RESULTS: The iOCT system  was usable in conjunction with common chromovitrectomy dyes and tamponades. The  surgeons reported that iOCT imaging provided additional information in 74.1{\%} of  the posterior and combined surgical cases, which resulted in altered  decision-making in 41.9{\%} of the cases. The iOCT imaging time, on average,  amounted to 167 seconds. In anterior procedures, the surgeons reported gaining  additional information in 22.2{\%} of all cases, but no cases of altered  decision-making were reported. Hereby, the iOCT imaging time amounted to 117  seconds, on average. CONCLUSION: The demonstrated results suggest iOCT has the  potential to improve the quality of posterior and anterior segment surgery.",

abstract="PURPOSE: After 48 months, unresolved macular edema secondary to central retinal  vein occlusion (CRVO) is present in more than half of the patients treated with  ranibizumab/bevacizumab. Switching therapy to aflibercept, a more recent vascular  endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, as well as VEGF-B and placental  growth factor inhibitor, might improve the clinical outcome in patients with CRVO  who respond insufficiently to ranibizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: The presented  study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n = 13) responding  insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6  weeks or more frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to  aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and extend' regime. The  injection interval, relapse-free interval, central retinal thickness, central  retinal volume, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated  prior to switching to aflibercept and at month 6 and year 1 after switching  therapy. RESULTS: From baseline to year 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept,  the mean injection interval (primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p =  0.023) and the relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003). The mean central  retinal thickness decreased by 195.84 {\textmu}m and the mean central retinal volume (6  mm diameter) by -1.81 mm3 (p = 0.007). Correspondingly, the mean ETDRS score  increased from 66.15 at baseline to 76.54 letters at year 1 after switching  therapy to aflibercept (+10.38 letters, p = 0.021). The IOP was not statistically  significantly affected (-1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.196). CONCLUSION: Switching therapy  from intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab to aflibercept in insufficiently  responding macular edema secondary to CRVO elongates the injection interval and  the relapse-free interval and provides an improved anatomical as well as  functional outcome.",

abstract="PURPOSE: To analyze foveal avascular zone (FAZ) dimensions and symmetry in  patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared to healthy controls using  optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT angiography). METHODS: OCT  angiography was performed via an Avanti® RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc.,  Fremont, CA, USA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy adults. A  frame centered on the fovea was used for FAZ measurements. The borders of the  superficial vascular layer were defined as 3 $\mu$m below the internal limiting  membrane (ILM) and 15 $\mu$m below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the deep  vascular layer as15 $\mu$m and 70 $\mu$m below the IPL, respectively. Angles of maximum  FAZ diameter were measured in all eyes by two graders. RESULTS: In healthy eyes  (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}25), the FAZ surrounding vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical or  horizontal oval symmetrical formation with a maximum diameter usually on the  horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic eyes (N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}29) presented with disintegrity  of the vascular arcades, resulting in an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer,  the mean horizontal FAZ diameter was significantly larger in the DR group (753 $\mu$m  {\textpm}272 $\mu$m) than in the control group (573 $\mu$m {\textpm}177 $\mu$m, p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.029). The difference  was even more pronounced in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 $\mu$m {\textpm}194 $\mu$m  in the control group and 1009 $\mu$m {\textpm}342 $\mu$m in the DR group (p{\thinspace}={\thinspace}0.001).  Furthermore, in the superficial layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was  0{\textdegree} ({\textpm}15{\textdegree}) or 90{\textdegree} ({\textpm}15{\textdegree}) in 72.0 {\%} of healthy eyes. In eyes with DR, the angle was  0{\textdegree} ({\textpm}15{\textdegree}) or 90{\textdegree} ({\textpm}15{\textdegree}) in only 6.9 {\%} of cases, due to the irregular  configuration of the FAZ. CONCLUSIONS: OCT angiography is capable of imaging  retinal vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can detect  disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ, thus differentiating DM  from healthy eyes. Vascular abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep  vascular layer.",
